[Github](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/sdh-controller-prompts)

various alternative button prompts for the gamemode ui for use with the [CSS Loader Plugin](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader)

![preview screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/sdh-controller-prompts/master/.github/preview.jpg){: .showcase .sc-full}

### Included prompts:

* Nintendo
  * Coloured (SNES Style)
  * Monochrome (Switch Style)
* Playstation
  * Coloured (Dualshock [3] Style)
  * Monochrome (Dualsense Style)

images are svg's, so they scale nicely and work well with the colour filters (e.g. in the vgui themed keyboard)

i may do a coloured xbox one at some point, if requested
