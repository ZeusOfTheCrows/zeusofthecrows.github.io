# Zeus' Enhanced VPad Snooper

A simple homebrew for testing the input data on the PS Vita™ made on [Lua Player Plus Vita](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-vita)

Originally created by Smoke5, converted to Lua by Keinta15

**Features:**

(most of it's not my work, i just added features {highlighted} that i was missing)

* highlight currently pressed buttons
* visual feedback & absolute numbers of analogue stick input
* visual feedback of touchscreen/touchpad, including multitouch
* _max range of analogue stick input (useful for adjusting deadzones)_
* stereo audio tester
* _is now a “safe” homebrew, as i saw no reason otherwise_
* _a better colourscheme ([gruvbox dark](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox))_
