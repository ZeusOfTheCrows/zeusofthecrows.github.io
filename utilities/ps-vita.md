# VPad Tester & Configurator

Download [coming soon] {{ site.sep_char }} [Github](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/VPad-Tester-and-Configurator)

PSVita hardware tester, with support for configuring Rinnegatamante's AnalogsEnhancer plugin.

made with [Lua Player Plus Vita](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-vita).

![preview screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/VPad-Tester-and-Configurator/master/img/preview.png){: .showcase .sc-full}

### Features:

* highlight currently pressed buttons
* visual feedback & absolute numbers of analogue stick input
* visual feedback of touchscreen/touchpad, including multitouch
* max range of analogue stick input (useful for adjusting deadzones)
* reading (and eventually writing) the config file for AnalogsEnhancer
* stereo audio tester

comes in both safe and unsafe versions. the unsafe version is required to modify Yoti's ur0: mod of AnalogsEnhancer; and possibly other features in future

this app is an extended version of a utility created by Smoke5, and initially converted to Lua by Keinta15; but almost none of that code still exists, so i thought it should be in its own repo
