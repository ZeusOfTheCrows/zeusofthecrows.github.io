		<section id="des">
			<h2>Demon's Souls</h2>
			<p>
				very close to being the best game fromsoft have made. despite being the
				lowest budget and the game predicted to fail, it has the best lore, the
				most interesting story, and the most enthralling & cohesive world
				design:
			</p>
			<p>
				want upgrade ore? head to the mines. want healing items? kill soldiers
				in the castle. want souls? head the the ethereal shrine of storms.
				only game apart from elden ring that makes sense in this way
			</p>
			<figure class="img-aside right" style="--rot: 10deg">
				<img src="/stadt/assets/images/stamps/demons.png"
					alt="demon's souls stamp"
					data-img-src="https://www.deviantart.com/arconte/art/stamp-demons-souls-160629029" />
			</figure>
			<p>
				the game that started the annoying runbacks in souls games, but the
				only game in which the runbacks are actually good: in demon's souls,
				the bosses aren't in any way difficult, they're more of a puzzle than a
				combat trial. the combat comes in the form of navigating the enemies,
				who are placed in such a way that they have to be fought. no more
				tedious dashing past enemies like in later games; every boss attempt
				requires enjoyable engagement
			</p>
			<p>
				it would be the best fromsoft game if it weren't for a few major flaws,
				that from have since fixed with later games:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					having to endure a loading screen to travel back to the nexus every
					time one wants to level up, dump/upgrade items, travel to another
					area
				</li>
				<li>
					having to worry about running out of healing, every time you die is
					≥1 grass wasted. i hardly use any > half moon grass until i have the
					ring of regeneration
				</li>
				<li>
					the item burden system is stupid, and feels like it's only jammed in
					because every other rpg has one
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>valley of defilement sucks though</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				this section is solely about the ps3 original,
				as the 2020 bluepoint remake is soul-less (heh), generic and
				bland-looking
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="ds1">
			<h2>Dark Souls</h2>
			<p>
				shows that all these games proclaiming "fast-paced combat" oughtn't be
			</p>
			<p>
				the crowning glory of the soulsborne series. the environment design is
				almost on par with demon's souls; it's the only game i've ever played
				that feels like the map was designed to be used by residents rather than
				played as a game. in fact, everything about the game feels like it
				doesn't give a shit if you play it or not
			</p>
			<img src="/stadt/assets/images/opinions/onion.jpg"
				class="banner top outdent-9x"
				alt="our favourite onion boy thinking"
				data-img-src="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/y8eadt/dark_souls_reimagined_in_topdown_perspective_full/" />
			<p>
				it fixes all of demon's souls' major flaws: the estus system refills
				healing items every death; bonfires allow levelling, repairing equipment,
				upgrading weapons, and storing items; though the item burden has
				[thankfully] been removed entirely
			</p>
			<p>
				i almost don't have anything negative to say about it
			</p>
			<p>blighttown sucks though</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				this section is primarily about the remastered version,
				as that's the one i played,
				but this applies to the vanilla version as they're practically the same
				apart from performance issues

		<section id="ds2">
			<h2>Dark Souls II</h2>
			<figure class="img-aside left" style="--rot: 345deg">

			<p>
				much more "fantastic" than des/ds1, with brighter colours than the
				sickly green of des or the washed out grunge of ds1. unfortunately,
				however i think means one loses the juxtaposition of the anor londo
				reveal.
				heide's tower of flame, for example, is just as pretty as anor londo,
				but i don't think it feels the same as it's not in comparison to the
				depths, blighttown, and then sen's fortress
			</p>
			<p>
				the slowest game in the series i think? but that allows it to be the
				hardest. rather than a pure test of reflexes, it's an actual test of
				strategy, game knowledge, and other skills. <!-- add more here -->
				i don't like the parry mechanic though. unlike ds1, there's a startup
				animation, which means that rather than parrying when the attack is
				about to land, one has to parry as soon as the attack animation starts
			</p>

			<p>
				so many optional bosses and alternative routes! don't want to fight the
				bastard ruin sentinels? take a walk through a wall with a face! can't
				be arsed with the singeing demon? just disable the flames and climb the
				ladder!
				don't want to fight any of the four main bosses? just, like, don't
				bother!
			</p>
			<p>
				i think they realised ds1's mistakes about the runback being too boring,
				and tried to fix it. unfortunately it's not quite as good as des, as
				they did so by making enemies have a longer aggro range and mist gates
				have no i-frames rather than by pure
				enemy placement and environment design, but it's still pretty good
			</p>
			<p>the gutter sucks though</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				this section is primarily about the scholar of the first sin revision,
				as i feel that is the definitive version (enemy placements are more
				lore friendly, etc.),
				but a lot of this applies to the vanilla version as well
			</p>

		<h2>Here be <del>Dragons</del> <ins>Negativity</ins></h2>
		<p>
			i'm worried from might not make another good game. elden ring was a step
			in the right direction, but it is so far from their hayday that it's
			almost worth discounting. observe this graph:
		</p>
		<img src="/stadt/assets/images/opinions/fromsoft.svg"
			class="indent-9x fullwidth-graph"
			alt="chart showing a bell curve of from software's quality, peaking with
				dark souls 1" />
		<p>
			bear in mind this was not the order in which i played them, this shape
			started to form subconsciously in my head and it was not until elden ring
			broke the trend that i noticed it. bloodborne is (as of
			<time>2022-11-24</time>) the most recent game that i played, and it
			perfectly fitted into its slot (between ds2 & ds3, but much closer to the
			latter)
		</p>
		<p>
			frankly it's shameful that the so called "b team" can do so much better
			a job than the a team. maybe miyazaki is the problem?

		<h2>Axiom Verge</h2>
			absolutely fantastic, to the point where i've played through it at least
			three times; and i almost never play non-soulslikes more than once

		<h2>Blasphemous</h2>
			this has everything i like from the castlevania series; but it's better in

			it barely scrapes into the category of metroidvania, as it doesn't have
			combat ability gating and the ability gating it does have isn't necessary

				Super Metroid
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					honestly <strong>the</strong> best metroid game. they started out so
					strong (i realise it's not the first metroid game. but it's probably
					the
					oldest game on this list). entire essays have been written on why
					super
					is so good, so i doubt there's anything new i could say here. the only
					negative thing i can think of is that the final boss
					(<span class="spoiler">phase 1</span>) is more annoying than difficult
					with those bullshit little disks; but that's immediately offset by how
					fucking cool <span class="spoiler">the phase 2 transition is</span>

				Metroid II: Return of Samus
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					i actually haven't finished this one, but i have played most of it, as
					well as all of am2r <em>and</em> samus returns; so i'm including it
					(partly for comparison)
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Metroid Fusion
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					…aaand what an immediate comedown. possibly the worst 2d game in my
					opinion, for controversial reasons. it could have been so good – the
					story's good, the writing's good, the boss æsthetic is good, the
					pixel art is <em>so good</em>… (apart from the fusion suit. that's
					just ugly, and i was so sad to see it re-used in dread)…
					and it's all let down by the actual gameplay.
				</p>
				<img src="/stadt/assets/images/opinions/nightmare.png"
					style="display: block; margin-inline: auto">
				<p>
					i realise it had to be a little more linear for the handheld format;
					but i think metroid 2 did it better. it feels like it's not designed
					to backtrack for hidden secrets, but they hid them anyway? i don't
					quite know why, it's just tedious. also the bosses require no
					strategy. it's not that they're not difficult,
					it's that the best technique for every boss is stand in the corner,
					hold fire, and hope. anything else gets one killed quicker.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Metroid Prime
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					absolutely fantastic. so fucking good.
					not only did retro studios do such a great job
					with translating the metroid/metroidvania formula to a 3d environment,
					there are so many little touches and signs of love. the visor accruing
					condensation in hot areas or when exposed to steam; the reflections of
					samus' face in bright light; the morphball starting out wiggly then
					gradually aligning itself to vertical with the trail behind it...
					<img src="chefskiss" alt="" /> absolutely perfect, no notes
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Metroid: Zero Mission
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					honestly i don't mind this one. i can see many reasons why people
					dislike it, but i think it's actually pretty good. also, nestroid
					really needed a remake. it's fairly faithful to nestroid as far as i
					can see, apart from quality of life updates and being quite a bit
					easier
				</p>
				<p>
					i can see why people hated the reveal of samus
					<span class="spoiler">as <q>yet another skinny
					blond girl in a skintight suit</q>, especially as it's constantly
					played
					for sex appeal; but do i like the juxtaposition of samus as this
					invulnerable bounty hunter disarmed and defenceless; and
					yet despite being almost completely unarmed she still outfoxes the
					space
					pirates (dumb name) and gets her suit back, with nothing but a
					stun-pistol</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					i also understand why people dislike that section, as it's rather
					incongruous with the standard metroid gameplay; but i think it makes a
					nice change of pace – especially after playing through what was
					effectively an entire game
				</p>
				<p>
					the one thing i <em>really dislike</em> is the introduction of
					<span class="spoiler">samus being brought up by the chozo. the feeling
					in prime of exploring the ancient halls of some archæic civilisation,
					zero mission completely undercut by saying <q>oh actually no, samus
					grew up with them and the whole species went extinct in less than 20
					years for an unknown reason.</q></span>. i hate it so much.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Metroid Prime 2: Echoes
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					i <em>do not know</em> why i didn't like this one. i've really no
					idea. but i just found it <em>so</em> tedious; and despite getting
					<em>almost</em> to the end, it's the only metroid game i've given up
					on due to boredom
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Another Metroid 2 Remake [AM2R]
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					i realise it's not an official entry, but a) it's one of the best
					fangames i've ever played, it's so well done it <em>feels</em>
					like an official entry, and b) it's actually one of <em>the</em> best
					metroid games; so i feel like i have to include it here

		<h2>Castlevania</h2>
		<details>
		<summary>
			honestly i wish i liked castlevania more than i do. it ticks so many
			boxes: oozing with dark gothic style, vampires, creatures from various
			mythologies:
			<ul>
				<li>warg - norse/germanic;</li>
				<li>scylla - greek;</li>
				<li>werewolf - english/germanic;</li>
				<li>owl - fictional bird;</li>
				<li>quetzalcoatl - aztec;</li>
				<li>catoblepas - ethiopian;</li>
				<li>efreet - islamic;</li>
				<li>lilith - notably, christianity</li>
			</ul>
			various naked/almost-naked enemies, and numerous christian icons and
			symbols sprinkled throughout. it should have everything i like, but i just
			cannot get into them.
			the metroidvania style games are pretty good, but i just can't get into
			the linear entries. even rondo of blood, widely considered to be pretty
			good, i've never got further than a couple levels in before giving up. i
			had pretty high hopes for lords of shadow actually, as it seems to be a
			<i>god of war</i> knock-off (another series i love), but i have never
			finished it
		</summary>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				Symphony of the Night
			</dt>
			<dd>
				i'm honestly not sure why this game is considered so good. i did enjoy
				my time with it once i got into it; but that was only after <i>aria of
				sorrow</i> had got me into the castlevania gameplay
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Aria of Sorrow
			</dt>
			<dd>
				my favourite cv game (although possibly only because it's the first one
				i actually enjoyed). i'll admit it's pretty similar to sotn, though i
				don't like soma as a character anywhere near as much as alucard, but it
				just seems better in every way (apart from, i guess, resolution /
				graphical fidelity)
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Dawn of Sorrow
			</dt>
			<dd>
				as an immediate sequel to aria of sorrow i did have higher hopes than
				this game lived up to. it's still pretty good – albeit i played a
				romhack that removed the need to use the touchscreen – and i definitely
				enjoyed playing it; but it <em>does not</em> live up to aria
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
		<details>
		<summary>
			<p>
			considering <i>symphony of the night</i>, one of the seminal and eponymous
			games of the genre, was inspired by link to the past, i think it's fair to
			include the entire series on this page. not <i>breath of the wild</i> or
			<i>tears of the kingdom</i> though, as they're their own completely
			different genre in my opinion
			</p>
		</summary>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				A Link to the Past
			</dt>
			<dd>
				aged very well; not the best in the series but still great and well
				worth playing
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Link's Awakening
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
				now i can't say that this is objectively the best zelda game, but it is
				definitely my favourite! i always enjoy when a game doesn't quite take
				itself seriously, and link's awakening mixes up the formula just enough
				to keep things interesting
				</p>
				<p>
				i'm not sure it works that well if one hasn't played lttp first, but as
				i had it immediately became my favourite
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Ocarina of Time
			</dt>
			<dd>
				honestly i haven't much positive to say about this one, so we'll move
				swiftly onward. whilst it must have been pretty impressive in 1998 to
				see hyrule in 3d, it has aged like milk behind a microwave
			<dt>
				Majora's Mask
			</dt>
			<dd>
				well they really turned it around here. i'm not sure if it really counts
				as a m.v. with the time travel gimmick, but it's unique and works really
				well
			</dd>
			<dt>
				The Wind Waker
			</dt>
			<dd>
				my favourite 3d game, and second favourite overrall! the artstyle is
				absolutely timeless; the combat, whist simplistic, is a great evolution
				from oot; the characters are whimsical and fun (apart from beadle. fuck
				beadle.)... everything about it is just great
			<dt>
				Twilight Princess
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					honestly so much better than i expected, from its reputation around
					the internet. maybe it's just because i'm an edgy prick so i
					appreciate its darker tone,
					i'm not sure i can say it does anything <em>hugely</em> original, but
					what it does do it does competently enough to be enjoyable
				</p>
				<p>
					the rearrangement of the
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXeEx-x_Nxg&t=1157s">hyrule
					castle theme</a> is just haunting;
					possibly my favourite since link to the past. especially the way it
					fills out as one advances through the dungeon
