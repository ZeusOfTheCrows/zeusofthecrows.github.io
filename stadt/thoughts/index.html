			<summary><h3>Preamble</h3></summary>
			<p>
				okay so i've always been a fan of vector graphics - <small>why in this
				world of rapidly increasing resolutions are we tying our images to pixel
				sizes? most of the time one can't see the pixels anyways, and it always
				seems to break</small> - but i've only just had the idea of applying it
				to a "Now!" button
			</p>
			<p>
				however, when trying to create one i found a sore lack of information on
				animating them, so i'll write this as a sort of guide. there are three
				ways to create an animated svg (herein ASVG), but i'll only be looking at
				<abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">smil</abbr>,
				as i don't like javascript and css animations are …just css animations
			</p>
			<p>
				first thing to do is decide if asvg is right for you, so consider this
				before making one:
			</p>

			<table style="font-size: 0.8em">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>benefits</th>
						<th>malefits</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tr>
					<td>
						the big one: infinite scalability. your button is future-proof, and
						can be displayed at any size as sharp as the day you made it
					</td>
					<td>
						the support is just not great. it's not even as good as
						apng. i think all modern browsers support asvg, but i don't think any
						image viewers do (certainly gwenview does not).
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						there are no "proprietary" source files (.ase, .xcf), as svg's have
						layers baked in, and are viewable in a text editor
					</td>
					<td>
						i can't find any programmes that properly support asvg, so
						you'll have to write the xml manually
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						you'll be the coolest kid on the block, with your button in a
						unique(ish) format
					</td>
					<td>
						depending on the number of elements, they tend to be slightly
						bigger (~56kb for animated, ~32kb for static; compared to ~16kb for
						apng, ~22kb for gif) than the tiny 88x31 size of ordinary buttons
					</td>
				</tr>

			<p>
				still want to make one? well here's some info:
			</p>
			<p>
				the first thing to do is make your normal svg. there are
				<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_vector_graphics_editors">
				many programmes</a>
				to do this: i use <a href="https://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a> usually,
				as i started using it when boxysvg didn't support linux, but i think
				<a href="https://boxy-svg.com/">boxysvg</a> is better. there are plenty
				of tutorials for vector editing, so i won't bother to say much about
				that here
			</p>
			<p>
				a couple things of note though:
			</p>
			<p>
				i made mine in 88x31, as it was an easy way to get the ratio right, but
				there's no reason not to make yours in 176x62, or 44x15½, or whatever
			</p>
			<p>
				when you've finished editing, duplicate
				your text layers, hide one, and <strong>bake the other to paths</strong>
				(inkscape: <samp>path</samp> → <samp>object to path</samp>). this means
				if your svg is being viewed on a device without your fonts installed, the
				text still shows up correctly
			</p>
			<p>
				you'll probably be fine if using something like times new roman, but it's
				very little effort and makes it more portable
			</p>

			<summary><h3>Animating</h3></summary>

			<p>
				now, you're ready to animate. surprisingly, the best visual editor, i've
				found, is a browser. <small>i used firefox, but i imagine safari or
				vivaldi would work just as well.</small>
				the devtools work for svg as well as html (they're just types of xml), so
				just open your svg, press <kbd>F12</kbd>, and your changes will be
				reflected in real time
			</p>
			<p>
				you have three basic tag options:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					<code>&lt;animate&gt;</code>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					animate an svg property (e.g. rx {radius x-axis}):
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate">mdn</a>
				</dd>
				<dt>
					<code>&lt;animateTransform&gt;</code>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					animate size, rotation, & position (anything that comes under css'
					<code>transform</code> property). this is the one i used in the above
					button
				</dd>
				<dt>
					<code>&lt;animateMotion&gt;</code>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					move an object along a path. i have never used this
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<ol>
				<li>
					decide what type of motion you want, then right click on the element
					you wish to animate. for the example button, i chose the
					<code>&lt;g id="text935&gt;</code> as it is the <u>g</u>roup that
					contains all of the "Now!" letters that i baked to paths.
				</li>
				<li>
					add your <code>&lt;animate[Transform]&gt;</code> tag as an immediate
					child of your chosen element<sup>†</sup>
					<ul>
						<li>
							i believe it can be any child, but i tend to add it as a final
							child by duplicating the last element, right-clicking, selecting
							"edit as svg", and then deleting the whole thing and typing in my
							code
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					if using <code>&lt;animateTransform type="scale"&gt;</code>, you will
					probably need a
					<code>transform-origin</code> css property - i just use trial and
					error to find it
				</li>
				<li>
					unlike css, no values need units, all are in pixels
					<br />
					you can either use <code>from="x [y] [z]"</code> &
					<code>to="x [y] [z]"</code> properties, or a
					<code>values="x [y] [z]; x [y] [z]; [x [y] [z]]"</code> property.
					<br />
					scale can take either one or two values space separated.
				</li>
				<li>
					for easing, you can either use the keySplines property (the proper
					way) or the hacky way i did (<code>values="1;0.9;0.6;0.5;0.6;0.9;1</code>)
					which i think looks fine at small sizes
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				that is what i have found with my experimentation. i will
				update with more if/when i find it, or you can message me a question,
				or check the few
				<a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-animatetransform-for-inline-svg-animation--cms-22296">decent</a>
				<a href="https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/SVG-SMIL_animation_tutorial">tutorials</a>
				i have found
			</p>
			<p>
				<sup>†</sup> if using <code>animateTransform</code>, it will override
				any <code>transform="whatever(x)"</code> property. either apply this to
				all children manually, or move/scale the object without using
				<code>transform=""</code>

		<h2>I Prefer the Nintendo/PS-Japan Controller Layout</h2>

		<p>
			in light of sony changing their enter button to
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-blu);">X</kbd> in japan to mirror the
			western layout, i thought i'd write down why i think they made the wrong
			choice
		</p>
		<p>
			i don't feel very strongly about this, and i agree that sony had to fix
			the east/west dichotomy, nevertheless when weighing up an almost
		</p>
		<p>
			now, as much as i loathe sony, when talking about button placements it's
			easier to use the unambiguous ones; so from here on out:
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-red);">Ο</kbd> = ntdo
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-red);">A</kbd>, xinput
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-red);">B</kbd>;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-blu);">Χ</kbd> = ntdo
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-ylw);">B</kbd>, xinput
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-grn);">A</kbd>;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-ppl);">Π</kbd> = ntdo
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-grn);">Y</kbd>, xinput
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-blu);">X</kbd>;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-grn);">Δ</kbd> = ntdo
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-blu);">X</kbd>, xinput
			<kbd style="color:var(--s-ylw);">Y</kbd>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				it just makes sense. most of us live in a left→right society, so the
				"forward" (accept) action should be to the right of "backward". also,
				having ✘ to accept is just wrong
			</li>
			<li>
				it allows <kbd style="color:var(--s-blu);">X</kbd> to be "primary
				action" (i.e. jump, dodge) and <kbd style="color:var(--s-red);">O</kbd>
				to be "interact", allowing one to pick up an item and dismiss the
				prompt with ease (e.g. dark souls)
				<ul>
					<li>
						i hoped breath of the wild would make this mainstream, especially
						with jump on <kbd style="color:var(--s-grn);">Δ</kbd>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				it spreads wear evenly. on my xbox controllers
				<kbd style="color:var(--s-blu);">X</kbd> is worn out and mushy, whereas
				on my switch controller <kbd style="color:var(--s-blu);">X</kbd
				>/<kbd style="color:var(--s-red);">O</kbd> are roughly even
			</li>
			<li>
				the nintendo layout came first (sort of)
			</li>
			<li>
				sony specific: from a business perspective, too. sony would be in the
				majority whichever way, but as i'd say their greater competitor is
				microsoft, making it easier to transition to xbox seems odd. forming a
				group with nintendo, thereby locking xinput out, seemed like the better
				choice to me
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			of course, none of this really matters to me, as i play through steam
			input, and can (and do) therefore map the enter/cancel buttons however i
			choose. that being said, it is a bit annoying how "accept" & "jump" are
			often tied to the same button
		</p>

		<h2>Tabs are the Obvious Choice, Really</h2>

		<p>
			i will not reiterate the obvious, and far more important,
			<a href="https://adamtuttle.codes/blog/2021/tabs-vs-spaces-its-an-accessibility-issue/">
			accessibility arguments</a>; as others have
			<a href="https://ww.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/">done so
			quite sufficiently</a>. nor will i try to reiterate the many good points
			<a href="https://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/">
			that others have made</a>, or
			<a href="https://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/ ">offer alternative
			solutions</a>, as i'm sure others have done so more astutely
		</p>

		<p>
			no; instead, to get my point across, i'll request you imagine a different
			world, a parallel universe if you will
		</p>
		<p>
			imagine a world in which the horizontal tabulation character was never
			invented, and all indentation is done with spaces
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which every time one pastes code in from another place, it has
			to be futzed with and converted to 2, 4, 8 or whichever width one is
			currently using
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which one has to hope the ide is intelligent enough to insert
			4 characters when pressing a single key, and to delete 4 characters when
			pressing backspace/delete once, <b>but <em>only</em> when all the
			characters to the left of the cursor are whitespace</b> (or right,
			presumably, in rtl langs)
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which one needs the indentation depth for a project to
			be agreed upon by the entire team prior to starting
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which the space character has differing semantic meanings
			depending upon where on the page it resides
		</p>
		<p>
			now imagine someone invents a character that can do all that
			automatically. a character that allows everyone to choose what width they
			find easiest to read, and like any personal preference, that width is
			specific to them and does not inconvenience their teammates.
		</p>
		<p>
			imagine that somebody discovers a number between 8 and 10, and uses that
			space to encode this character into ascii, so it will work in any text
			field that supports ascii or utf-8 (i.e. almost all); just by pressing a
			single key, that is already all keyboards, <kbd>Tab ↹</kbd>
		</p>
		<p>
			surely this would be heralded as a technological revelation? surely this
			man would be paraded from the rooftops, as a true reincarnation of the
			deus mechanicus?
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p>
			space indentation is one of the reasons poor programmers are stuck using
			monospace fonts, when the rest of the computing world moved on to
			proportional, arguably as early as
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_(typeface)">1984</a>;
			we could have nice <a href="https://input.djr.com/">proportional fonts
			such as this</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			when using tabs for indentation, you're using a
			<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US720520">century proven</a>
			and semantically appropriate method. <br />
			when using spaces, you're flouting this tradition in favour of a hacky
			solution; using characters not as intended, but as a system no better
			than mashing the <kbd>X</kbd> key on a typewriter in lieu of a proper
			delete key
		</p>
		<p>
			now consider that before programmable computers were widespread, someone
			had the forsight to invent a character that can do all of these things
			automatically, and think <q>this will be such a useful feature, we will
			assign it to one of the <em>127 characters</em> we have available</q>. i
			can't believe people just throw that away for the argument <q>it looks
			a bit better on stack overflow</q>
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p>
			and that's the thing i understand least - there seems to be absolutely
			<strong>no</strong> cogent argument for spaces‽
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<q>some software that was obsolete before i started coding doesn't
				really like tabs much</q>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				why are we beholden to insufficient software? ␉ most certainly
				existed when they were written, so i don't quite know what the excuse
				was. most modern software deals fine with tabs, even css:
				<code style="white-space: nowrap;">
					<span class="code opr">tab-size</span>:
					<span class="code val">8</span>;
				</code>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<q>i can't enforce how my code is presented</q>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				good. code is not its fucking presentation - you can't dictate what
				font your code is read in, nor its colour or size; why should you try
				to dictate its indentation level?
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<q>i can't line things up properly with tabs</q>
			</dt>
			<dd>yes you can, watch:</dd>

		<h2>I Support Ethical Piracy</h2>

		<p>
			for a couple of reasons. most of these are conjecture, so take them

		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				usually, the pirate would not have bought the product anyway,
				so no money was lost
			</li>
			<li>
				it allows breaking into industries (e.g. photoshop for
				designers), when not making money
			</li>
			<li>
				it's a good way of testing software, especially in these days of
				a lack of shareware/demos
			</li>
			<li>

		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			now, my opinions on what classes as "ethical" differ per
			medium.<sup>†</sup>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				music: i have no problems pirating; but i don't as spotify is a
				great music discovery service
			</li>
			<li>film/tv series: i actively encourage piracy</li>
			<li>fonts: hmmmnn…</li>
			<li>video games:
				<ul>
					<li>indie games: i'll never pirate</li>
					<li>
						AA games: i might pirate as sort of free demo, and buy it
						if i like it.
					</li>
					<li>
						AAA games: same as above; but if it's a studio i dislike
						(e.g. EA) i may not buy it at all
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			a: if you can find the music you want on cd (or other hard copy);
			that's great. if you can find it on bandcamp or another similar
			site, that's almost as great.
			if you can't, why spend money on "renting" a song
			from google or whomever, especially when almost none of it goes to
			the artist?
		</p>
		<p>
			b: i didn't use to, back when netflix was useful; but in these days
			of fragmented streaming services and non-ownership, i think it's
			actively immoral to keep funding these tech giants like amazon &
			disney.
		</p>
		<p>
			c: i don't know about fonts. they're too expensive to buy for most
			purposes, but they are only so expensive because they're that commonly
			pirated. ultimately, i'm okay with doing so for personal [local] use, but
			i'll try to find a free alternative for other uses
		</p>
		<p>d: look. say one boycotts these publishers. that's great. they
			don't get money, but you don't get games. but what if we could have
			the same situation but you get the games as well…
		</p>
		<p>
			i don't, however, pirate indie games. AAA studios are big enough to
			stand up for themselves; but indie studios, particularly those
			pushing the genre envelope, need all the help they can get
		</p>
		<p>
			i don't even pirate epic exclusive indie games. i'll wait until
			they come to steam. as much as i dislike epic, it's the smart
			business decision to accept their offers, and i don't think devs
			should be punished for that
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			but don't take the word of some internet schmuck;
			<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/harvard-lawyers-dont-think-that-piracy-is-theft-research-finds-220626/">
				take the word of several internet schmucks

		<h2>I Don't Think Dark Souls<sup>†</sup> Should Have an Easy Mode</h2>

		<p><strong>not for the reasons you think! hear me out!</strong></p>
		<p>
			i don't believe there is any value in being good at games, nor
			should one gatekeep those who like to enjoy a good power-fantasy.
		</p>
		<p>hear me out:</p>
		<h3>I Don't Believe DS <em>Should</em> Have an Easy Mode</h3>

		<p>
			not every piece of media is for everyone - i don't go into a cinema
			showing a rom-com, and complain about the lack of guns'n'ammo; i
			don't read <q>the life and times of winston churchill</q> and
			complain about the lack of greatsword wielding; i don't play
			amnesia and complain about the abundance of jump-scares.
		</p>
		<p>in the same vein, not every game is for everyone, and that's okay!
			if you're put off by ds' difficulty, there are plenty of other
			great games out there.
			<br />
			some (slightly easier) similar games worth playing:
			<ul>
				<li>hellpoint</li>
				<li>mortal shell</li>
				<li>code vein
					<small>ignore the art style, it's actually good</small>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/23067">nose</a>
					<small>
						(yes it's a blatant knock-off, but it's
						<em>really</em> good)
					</small>
				</li>
				<li>jedi: fallen order
					<small>(more like sekiro, but you get the picture)</small>
				</li>
				<li>mortem: fallen kingdom</li>
				<li>thymesia
					<small>i'm not sure it's actually any easier…</small>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			i never finished sekiro, because either i found it too hard, or the
			combat just didn't click for me. this does not mean i think sekiro
			is a bad game! it's just not for me
		</p>

		<h3>I Believe DS Should <em>Not</em> Have an Easy Mode</h3>

		<p>
			the difficulty in ds isn't just a gameplay element. it's a
			worldbuilding element. in ds, you are an undead on level footing
			with every other undead out there. the only thing keeping you from
			going hollow is your tenacity to push on and gain strength. if you
			were a force-wielding jedi, the story beats would feel (please
			excuse the pun) completely hollow.
		</p>
		<p>
			this does <strong>not</strong> extend to all souls-likes. i think
			souls-likes as a genre, should mostly have difficulty options. this is
			just about dark souls specifically, and how it sets up its world.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p>
			this does not apply to mods. i think all games should be moddable,
			and i don't think this matters in this case as mods have an
			inherent "unnofficiality" to them that make it plain that "this is
			not the intended way to play". but i think having a difficulty
			option in the main menu i fear would lead to many people trying the
			game, thinking "this is too hard", and completely missing the
			entire point of the game.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			that was all a bit controversial, so have a cat:
		</p>
		<pre class="ascii-art">
			           />    7
			          |  _  _|
			         /` = _x =
			        /        |
			  ____ /    \   /
			 /  __|     | | |
			|  (__ \____\_)_)
			 \____)

		<h2>CSS is Like a Zachtronics Game, Really</h2>
		<p>
			right. unlike a zt game, it's bollocks. it's inconsistent,
			confusing, and seemingly random.	it's clearly been designed by
			multiple people over decades, each with adifferent goal in mind.
			there are at least 6 different ways of centring items, depending
			upon its direction and parent.
			<br />
			off the top of my head:
			<ul>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">align-items</span>:
					<span class="code val">center</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">margin-inline</span>:
					<span class="code val">auto</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">text-align</span>:
					<span class="code val">center</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">justify-content</span>:
					<span class="code val">center</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">vertical-align</span>:
					<span class="code val">middle</span>;</code>
					<small class="code cmt">/* why is this one not center? */</small>
				</li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">transform</span>:
					<span class="code val">translate(0, -50%)</span>;
				</code></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			and, just like opus magnum, there is no "right" solution. i
			personally loathe flexbox, but think grid is so intuitive and
			lovely. just as mentioned in
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toD5D6PDofU&t=1132s">
				this video,</a>
			one can either meet the targets of clarity, concision, or ease /
			time to finish; but not all three simultaneously. all code is
			hard to read when it's written by someone else, but css i find
			particularly hard compared to its ease of understanding at the time
			of writing, especially as it requires holding 2+ files in ones head
			(as the structure of the related html file is important, as well
			as possible js files).
		</p>
		<p>
			and to be honest, that's fun. trying to figure out the "best" way
			to solve this puzzle, for æsthetics & maintainability, is just as
			good as TIS-100, and it's free! <em>and</em> you get something out
			of it at the end (more than just a steam achievement, at least)
