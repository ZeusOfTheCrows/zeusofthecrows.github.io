			<h3>opinion: i don't think dark souls† should have an easy mode</h3>

			<p><strong>not for the reasons you think! hear me out!</strong></p>

			<p>
				i don't believe there is any value in being good at games, nor should
				one gatekeep those who like to enjoy a power-fantasy.
			</p>

			<p>hear me out:</p>

			<h4>why ds <em>should</em> not have an easy mode</h4>

			<p>
				not every piece of media is for everyone - i don't go into a cinema
				showing a rom-com, and complain about the lack of guns'n'ammo; i don't
				read <i>the life and times of winston churchill</i> and complain about
				the lack of greatsword wielding; i don't play amnesia and complain
				about the abundance of jump-scares.
			</p>

			<p>in the same vein, not every game is for everyone, and that's okay! if
				you're put off by ds' difficulty, there are plenty of other great
				games out there. some souls-likes worth playing:
				<ul>
					<li>jedi: fallen order</li>
					<li>code vein</li>
					<li>mortal shell</li>
					<li>remnant: from the ashes (i haven't played this one)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				i never finished sekiro, because either i found it too hard, or the
				combat just didn't click for me. this does not mean i think sekiro is
				a bad game! it's just not for me
			</p>

			<h4>why ds should <em>not</em> have an easy mode</h4>

			<p>
				the difficulty in ds isn't just a gameplay element. it's a
				worldbuilding element. in ds, you are an undead on level footing with
				every other undead out there. the only thing keeping you from going
				hollow is your tenacity to push on and gain strength. if you were a
				force-wielding jedi, the story beats would feel (please excuse the
				pun) completely hollow.
			</p>

			<p>
				this does *not* extend to all souls-likes. i think souls-likes as a
				genre, should mostly have difficulty options. this is just about dark
				souls specifically and how it sets up its world.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>
				that was all a bit negative, so have a cat:
