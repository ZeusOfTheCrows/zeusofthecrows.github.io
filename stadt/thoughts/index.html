		<h2>tabs are the obvious choice, really</h2>

		<p>
			i will not reiterate the obvious, and far more important,
			<a href="https://adamtuttle.codes/blog/2021/tabs-vs-spaces-its-an-accessibility-issue/">
			accessibility arguments</a>; as others have
			<a href="https://ww.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/">done so
			quite sufficiently</a>. nor will i try to reiterate the many good points
			<a href="https://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/">
			that others have made</a>, or
			<a href="https://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/ ">offer alternative
			solutions</a>, as i'm sure others have done so more astutely
		</p>

		<p>
			no; instead, to get my point across, i'll request you imagine a different
			world, a parallel universe if you will
		</p>
		<p>
			imagine a world in which the horizontal tabulation character was never
			invented, and all indentation is done with spaces
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which every time one pastes code in from another place, it has
			to be futzed with and converted to 2, 4, 8 or whichever width one is
			currently using
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which one has to hope the ide is intelligent enough to insert
			4 characters when pressing a single key, and to delete 4 characters when
			pressing backspace/delete once, <b>but <em>only</em> when all the
			characters to the left of the cursor are whitespace</b> (or right,
			presumably, in rtl langs)
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which one needs <samp>.editorconfig</samp> files to force the
			indentation to ones preferred width; and that width needs to be agreed
			upon by the entire team prior to starting
		</p>
		<p>
			a world in which the space character has differing semantic meanings
			depending upon where on the page it resides
		</p>
		<p>
			now imagine someone invents a character that can do all that
			automatically. a character that allows everyone to choose what width they
			find easiest to read, and like any personal preference, that width is
			specific to them and does not inconvenience their teammates.
		</p>
		<p>
			imagine that somebody discovers a number between 8 and 10, and uses that
			space to encode this character into ascii, so it will work in any text
			field that supports ascii or utf-8 (i.e. almost all); just by pressing a
			single key, that is already all keyboards, <kbd>Tab ↹</kbd>
		</p>
		<p>
			surely this would be heralded as a technological revelation? surely this
			man would be paraded from the rooftops, as a true reincarnation of the
			deus mechanicus?
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p>
			space indentation is one of the reasons poor programmers are stuck using
			monospace fonts, when the rest of the computing world moved on to
			proportional, arguably as early as
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_(typeface)">1984</a>;
			we could have nice <a href="https://input.djr.com/">proportional fonts
			such as this</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			when using tabs for indentation, you're using a
			<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US720520">century proven</a>
			and semantically appropriate method. <br />
			when using spaces, you're flouting this tradition in favour of a hacky
			solution; using characters not as intended, but as a system no better
			than mashing the <kbd>x</kbd> key on a typewriter in lieu of a proper
			delete key
		</p>
		<p>
			now consider that before programmable computers were widespread, someone
			had the forsight to invent a character that can do all of these things
			automatically, and think <q>this will be such a useful feature, we will
			assign it to one of the <em>127 characters</em> we have available</q>. i
			can't believe people just throw that away for the argument <q>it looks
			a bit better on stack overflow</q>
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p>
			and that's the thing i understand least - there seems to be absolutely
			<strong>no</strong> cogent argument for spaces‽
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<q>some software that was obsolete before i started coding doesn't
				really like tabs much</q>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				why are we beholden to insufficient software? ␉ most certainly
				existed when they were written, so i don't quite know what the excuse
				was. most modern software deals fine with tabs, even css:
				<code style="white-space: nowrap;">
					<span class="code opr">tab-size</span>:
					<span class="code val">8</span>;
				</code>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<q>i can't enforce how my code is presented</q>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				good. code is not its fucking presentation - you can't dictate what
				font your code is read in, nor its colour or size; why should you try
				to dictate its indentation level?
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<q>i can't line things up properly with tabs</q>
			</dt>
			<dd>yes you can, watch:</dd>

		<h2>i support ethical piracy</h2>

		<p>
			for a couple of reasons. most of these are conjecture, so take them
			with a pinch of salt:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				usually, the pirate would not have bought the product anyway,
				so no money was lost
			</li>
			<li>
				it allows breaking into industries (e.g. photoshop for
				designers), when not making money
			</li>
			<li>
				it's a good way of testing software, especially in these days of
				a lack of shareware/demos
			</li>
			<li>
				it's a good way of avoiding giving money to corporations
				one dislikes (e.g. nintendo)
			</li>
		</ol>
		<div id="pirated-music" class="outdent-9x">
			<p>
				if you've come here from the prs button on the homepage, read this first
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					it's only one song at a time, so anyone using this site as a method of
					piracy is going to be waiting a long time for me to put up the specific
					song they want
				</li>
				<li>
					i've only downloaded it from youtube with youtube-dl, i haven't done
					anything almost everyone visiting this site couldn't have done
					for theirself
				</li>
				<li>
					it's sort of a form of free advertising, so i believe it will do more
					good than harm
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				if the current song is your music and you don't want it here; message
				me and i'll remove all references to it immediately
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			now, as for the common argument that "piracy is theft", no it's not. of
			course it's not. if it were, it wouldn't be called piracy. it would
			be called theft.
		</p>
		<p>let's say you have a neighbour called greg. greg just got a new car.
			you're jealous of greg. however, greg is a wizard; and a very kind
			one at that. he says to you
			<blockquote>
				i can see you want this car. i'll do you a favour. touch this
				car, and in a few hours, one exactly like it will turn up in
				your garage.
			</blockquote>
			do you gleefully thank the generous magus? or do you say
			<blockquote>
				thanks greg, but i'm too concerned about maserati's bottom line.
				i think i'll pass, and save up to possibly purchase my own.
			</blockquote>
			piracy is like this. somebody else is putting stuff up for free,
			that you can duplicate by
			<span class="captioned"
				title="any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
								- arthur c. clarke">
				magic.
			</span>why would you pass on this‽
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			now, my opinions on what classes as "ethical" differ per
			medium.<sup>†</sup>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				music: i have no problems pirating; but i don't as spotify is a
				great music discovery service
			</li>
			<li>film/tv series: i actively encourage piracy</li>
			<li>fonts: hmmmnn…</li>
			<li>video games:
				<ul>
					<li>indie games: i'll never pirate</li>
					<li>
						AA games: i might pirate as sort of free demo, and buy it
						if i like it.
					</li>
					<li>
						AAA games: same as above; but if it's a studio i dislike
						(e.g. EA) i may not buy it at all
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			a: if you can find the music you want on cd (or other hard copy);
			that's great. if you can find it on bandcamp or another similar
			site, that's almost as great.
			if you can't, why spend money on "renting" a song
			from google or whomever, especially when almost none of it goes to
			the artist?
		</p>
		<p>
			b: i didn't use to, back when netflix was useful; but in these days
			of fragmented streaming services and non-ownership, i think it's
			actively immoral to keep funding these tech giants like amazon &
			disney.
		</p>
		<p>
			c: i don't know about fonts. they're too expensive to buy for most
			purposes, but they are only so expensive because they're that commonly
			pirated. ultimately, i'm okay with doing so for personal [local] use, but
			i'll try to find a free alternative for other uses
		</p>
		<p>d: look. say one boycotts these publishers. that's great. they
			don't get money, but you don't get games. but what if we could have
			the same situation but you get the games as well…
		</p>
		<p>
			i don't, however, pirate indie games. AAA studios are big enough to
			stand up for themselves; but indie studios, particularly those
			pushing the genre envelope, need all the help they can get
		</p>
		<p>
			i don't even pirate epic exclusive indie games. i'll wait until
			they come to steam. as much as i dislike epic, it's the smart
			business decision to accept their offers, and i don't think devs
			should be punished for that
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			but don't take the word of some internet schmuck;
			<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/harvard-lawyers-dont-think-that-piracy-is-theft-research-finds-220626/">
				take the word of several internet schmucks

			<sup>†</sup>however, even if i've persuaded you with this piece, i

		<h2>i don't think dark souls<sup>†</sup> should have an easy mode</h2>

		<p><strong>not for the reasons you think! hear me out!</strong></p>
		<p>
			i don't believe there is any value in being good at games, nor
			should one gatekeep those who like to enjoy a good power-fantasy.
		</p>
		<p>hear me out:</p>
		<h3>i don't believe ds <em>should</em> have an easy mode</h3>

		<p>
			not every piece of media is for everyone - i don't go into a cinema
			showing a rom-com, and complain about the lack of guns'n'ammo; i
			don't read <q>the life and times of winston churchill</q> and
			complain about the lack of greatsword wielding; i don't play
			amnesia and complain about the abundance of jump-scares.
		</p>
		<p>in the same vein, not every game is for everyone, and that's okay!
			if you're put off by ds' difficulty, there are plenty of other
			great games out there.
			<br />
			some (slightly easier) similar games worth playing:
			<ul>
				<li>hellpoint</li>
				<li>mortal shell</li>
				<li>code vein
					<small>ignore the art style, it's actually good</small>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/23067">nose</a>
					<small>
						(yes it's a blatant knock-off, but it's
						<em>really</em> good)
					</small>
				</li>
				<li>jedi: fallen order
					<small>(more like sekiro, but you get the picture)</small>
				</li>
				<li>mortem: fallen kingdom</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			i never finished sekiro, because either i found it too hard, or the
			combat just didn't click for me. this does not mean i think sekiro
			is a bad game! it's just not for me
		</p>
		<h3>i believe ds should <em>not</em> have an easy mode</h3>

		<p>
			the difficulty in ds isn't just a gameplay element. it's a
			worldbuilding element. in ds, you are an undead on level footing
			with every other undead out there. the only thing keeping you from
			going hollow is your tenacity to push on and gain strength. if you
			were a force-wielding jedi, the story beats would feel (please
			excuse the pun) completely hollow.
		</p>
		<p>
			this does <strong>not</strong> extend to all souls-likes. i think
			souls-likes as a genre, should mostly have difficulty options. this is
			just about dark souls specifically, and how it sets up its world.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p>
			this does not apply to mods. i think all games should be moddable,
			and i don't think this matters in this case as mods have an
			inherent "unnofficiality" to them that make it plain that "this is
			not the intended way to play". but i think having a difficulty
			option in the main menu i fear would lead to many people trying the
			game, thinking "this is too hard", and completely missing the
			entire point of the game.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			that was all a bit controversial, so have a cat:
		</p>
		<pre class="ascii-art">
			           />    7
			          |  _  _|

		<h2>css is like a zachtronics game, really</h2>
		<p>
			right. unlike a zt game, it's bollocks. it's inconsistent,
			confusing, and seemingly random.	it's clearly been designed by
			multiple people over decades, each with adifferent goal in mind.
			there are at least 6 different ways of centring items, depending
			upon its direction and parent.
			<br />
			off the top of my head:
			<ul>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">align-items</span>:
					<span class="code val">center</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">margin-inline</span>:
					<span class="code val">auto</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">text-align</span>:
					<span class="code val">center</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">justify-content</span>:
					<span class="code val">center</span>;
				</code></li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">vertical-align</span>:
					<span class="code val">middle</span>;</code>
					<small class="code cmt">/* why is this one not center? */</small>
				</li>
				<li><code>
					<span class="code opr">transform</span>:
					<span class="code val">translate(0, -50%)</span>;
				</code></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			and, just like opus magnum, there is no "right" solution. i
			personally loathe flexbox, but think grid is so intuitive and
			lovely. just as mentioned in
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toD5D6PDofU&t=1132s">
				this video,</a>
			one can either meet the targets of clarity, concision, or ease /
			time to finish; but not all three simultaneously. all code is
			hard to read when it's written by someone else, but css i find
			particularly hard compared to its ease of understanding at the time
			of writing, especially as it requires holding 2+ files in ones head
			(as the structure of the related html file is important, as well
			as possible js files).
		</p>
		<p>
			and to be honest, that's fun. trying to figure out the "best" way
			to solve this puzzle, for æsthetics & maintainability, is just as
			good as TIS-100, and it's free! <em>and</em> you get something out
			of it at the end (more than just a steam achievement, at least)
