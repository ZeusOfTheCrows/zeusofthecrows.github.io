		<h2>tewksbury mediæval</h2>
			<p>
				just enjoyed going to the tewksbury mediæval festival - lovely warm
				weather,
			</p>
			<p>
				my rather crap phone (poco f1) made taking pictures without looking quite
				difficult, but i think some images are okay
			</p>
			<p>
				got a great view of the battle too - one of the best i've seen
