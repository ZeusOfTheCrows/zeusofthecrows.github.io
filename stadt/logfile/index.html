			don't get me wrong, rtx is an incredibly useful and powerful

			makes everything shiny and wet. none of the concrete looks like

			considering nobody knows the origin of "O.K.", i think it's a lot more
			likely to come from "och aye" than "orl korrekt", considering<br />
			a) that's pretty much how it would be approximated by most english
			   people<br>
			b) what even is orl korrekt. that's not a phrase. it was a very
				brief fad, from which no other artifacts have survived

			<abbr title="or you won't, i don't know you">you'll notice</abbr> most
			images on this site are apng, not gifs or webp.
			according to <a href="http://littlesvr.ca/apng/gif_apng_webp2.html">this
			site</a>, they're notably better. bearing in mind webp doesn't support
			indexed colour modes, driving up the filesize. in my experience, there's
			very little between apng & webp; but apng aren't made by google
