			i've just seen this image on <a href="mothcore.neocities.org/">
			mothcore's site</a>, and it really reminds me of a time when the dw
			writers absolutely didn't have a clue what they were doing, but they did
			their best anyways. and i think that's wonderful.

			<span class="captioned" title="or you won't, i don't know you">you'll
			notice</span> most images on this site are apng, not gifs or webp.
			according to <a href="http://littlesvr.ca/apng/gif_apng_webp2.html">this
			site</a>, they're notably better. bearing in mind webp doesn't support
			indexed colour modes, driving up the filesize. in my experience, there's
			very little between apng & webp; but apng aren't made by google
