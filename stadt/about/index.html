		<h2>name</h2>
		<p>
			back in [~2010?], when there was all the trend for "name generators", i
			was an edgy teen, and on a whim i tried a vampire name generator. it gave
			me "<em>Louis Arnauld, known in some regions as Zeus of the Crows</em>".
			soon after that, i needed a username for something online, and chose
			<em>zeusofthecrows</em> as it was fresh in my mind. i transitioned to
			PascalCase as i was learning c#, and in lieu of anything better i've
			stuck with it ever since. i know Zeus is a masculine name, but i've been
			using it so long it feels neutral. there is
			<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/vlthar/art/Zeus-845335738">zeus from
			overhit</a>, but a) i've never played it, & b) i don't look like that irl
		</p>

		<h2>assorted miscellany:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>i prefer #HEXA colours to #AHEX</li>
			<li>i own a crt monitor</li>
			<li>
				i own and plan to read the wh40k horus heresy books, but haven't
				got around to it yet
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>i'll fill this out further as i think of things</p>

		<h1>about the site</h1>

		<h2>why windows 9x?</h2>
		<p>
			because it's easy, really. i never properly used windows 9x for any
			period of time, though i did use the windows classic theme back when it
			existed (yes, even from a very young age i was nostalgic for a time
			when i didn't exist)
		</p>
		<p>
			being so simple means it's also quite open to customisation, hence the
			whole site is in the
			<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gruvbox/">gruvbox</a> colour palette
		</p>
		<p>
			if you want your own, feel free to use mine; but i'd advise against it:
			it's a mess. use something well made, like
			<a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">98.css</a>
		</p>

		<h2 id="site-rating">rating</h2>
		<p>
			in reality it's not really that explicit, but i don't want to have to
			hamper myself by having to adher to a site rating; especially as
			ratings are so subjective
		</p>
		<p>
			read the following and make your own decision as to whether to
			continue to browse
		</p>
		<p>actual contents include:</p>
		<table> <!-- ztodo these are hard to read -->
			<tr>
				<td>language</td>
				<td class="rating-3">high</td>
				<td>
					i consider meanings more important than words themselves
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>sexual content</td>
				<td class="rating-0">low-none</td>
				<td>
					not really my cup of tea, but i may feature some explicit art
					(not by me) if i like it
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>gore / violence</td>
				<td class="rating-1">low</td>
				<td>
					i'm not a huge fan of viscera, but i do like some of the
					warhammer dark mechanicum art
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>illegal content</td>
				<td class="rating-3">high</td>
				<td>
					i consider laws a set of morals for those with none of their
					own, so i tend to ignore them
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>other</td>
				<td class="rating-n">unkown</td>
				<td>
					please tell me if you find anything you think should have a
					content warning
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h2>site creation</h2>
		<p>this site is assembled by jekyll…</p>
		<p>
			now, before you consider me <q>not getting in the spirit of
			geocities</q>, it's mostly because my main site is hosted on
			github pages, and jekyll/sass support comes free with that.
		</p>
		<p>
			all the html is written by hand in sublime text
			<small>
				(i wanted a programme that wasn't electron, and therefore
				opened faster than a geriatric snail, so it was that or n++;
				and sublime's auto-tag closing is handy)
			</small>
			and the only thing is use sass for is nesting css, which i
			think is neater and more readable than flat css
		</p>

		<div id="sass-code-container">
			<!-- not super happy with the unindenting, but eh -->
			<code class="codeblock">
<span class="code obj">a</span> {
	<span class="code opr">cursor</span>: <span class="code val">pointer</span>;
	<span class="code obj">&</span>:<span class="code mod">link</span> {
		<span class="code opr">color</span>: <span class="code val">blue</span>;
	}
	<span class="code obj">&</span>:<span class="code mod">visited</span> {
		<span class="code opr">color</span>: <span class="code val">purple</span>;
	}
	<span class="code obj">a</span>:<span class="code mod">active</span> {
		<span class="code opr">color</span>: <span class="code val">red</span>;
	}
}
			</code>
			<p>VS</p>
			<code class="codeblock">
<span class="code obj">a</span> {
	<span class="code opr">cursor</span>: <span class="code val">pointer</span>;
}
<span class="code obj">a</span>:<span class="code mod">link</span> {
	<span class="code opr">color</span>: <span class="code val">blue</span>;
}
<span class="code obj">a</span>:<span class="code mod">visited</span> {
	<span class="code opr">color</span>: <span class="code val">purple</span>;
}
<span class="code obj">a</span>:<span class="code mod">active</span> {
	<span class="code opr">color</span>: <span class="code val">red</span>;
}
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			it's also duplicated data, which i'm not too keen on; but ghp gives
			me version history and all sorts of niceties, and neocities has
			the community aspect that i like, so not being able to pick one,
			i went for both
