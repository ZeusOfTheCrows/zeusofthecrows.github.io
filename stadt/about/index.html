					favourite drink letter:
					<span class="fav-item">bloody mary</span>
				</summary>
				<p>
					most people who know me assume it's tea, which is reasonable,
					but i'd drink many more bloody maries if
						<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
							<li>they weren't so bloody involved to make</li>
							<li>they weren't alcoholic: whilst i do like alcohol,
								sometimes it's not really appropriate
							</li>

					favourite cyrillic letter:
					<span class="fav-item">Ж ж</span>
				</summary>
				<p>
					look at it. it is two K's. it is the king of letters.
				</p>
				<p>
					also, no-one really knows where it came from. probably Ⰶ, but
					then where did that come from? Ϫ?

				<summary>
					least favourite latin letter:
					<span class="unfav-item">R r</span>
				</summary>
				<p>
					entirely because of its pronunciation in english
				</p>
				<p>
					what the fuck even is <span class="ipa">/ɹ/</span>. even
					<span class="ipa">/ʁ/</span> is better. just listen to it.
					<span class="ipa">/æɹəʊ/</span>…
					<span class="ipa">/tʃɹɛin/</span>…
					<span class="ipa"><strong>/stʃɹɛtʃt/</strong></span>!
					how is that one syllable‽
