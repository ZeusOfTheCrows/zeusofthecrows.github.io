			<h2>i support <mark>ethical</mark> piracy</h2>
			<p>there. i said it</p>
			<p>
				as for the common argument that "piracy is theft", no it's not. of
				course it's not. if it were, it wouldn't be called piracy. it would
				be called theft.
			</p>
			<p>let's say you have a neighbour called greg. greg just got a new car.
				you're jealous of greg. however, greg is a wizard; and a very kind
				one at that. he says to you
				<blockquote>
					i can see you want this car. i'll do you a favour. touch this
					car, and in a few hours, one exactly like it will turn up in
					your garage.
				</blockquote>
				do you gleefully thank the generous magus? or do you say
				<blockquote>
					thanks greg, but i'm too concerned about maserati's bottom line.
					i think i'll pass, and save up to purchase my own.
				</blockquote>
				piracy is like this. somebody else is putting stuff up for free,
				that you can duplicate by
				<span class="captioned" title="any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic">
					magic.
				</span>why would you pass on this‽
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				now, my opinions on what classes as "ethical" differ per medium.†
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					music: i have no problems pirating; but i don't as spotify is a
					great music discovery service
				</li>
				<li>film/tv series: i actively encourage piracy</li>
				<li>video games:
					<ul>
						<li>indie games: i'll never pirate</li>
						<li>
							AA games: i might pirate as sort of free demo, and buy it
							if i like it.
						</li>
						<li>
							AAA games: same as above; but if it's a studio i dislike
							(e.g. EA) i may not buy it at all
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				1: if you can find the music you want on cd (or other hard copy);
				that's great. if you can find it on bandcamp or another similar
				site, that's almost as great.
				if you can't, why spend money on "renting†" a song
				from google or whomever, especially when almost none of it goes to
				the artist?
			</p>
			<p>
				†read the t&c's - you don't own the music, you're renting it for as
				long as whatever storefront deigns to let you listen to it
			</p>
			<p>
				2: i didn't use to, back when netflix was useful; but in these days
				of fragmented streaming services and non-ownership, i think it's
				actively immoral to keep funding these tech giants like amazon &
				disney.
			</p>
			<p>3: look. say one boycotts these publishers. that's great. they
				don't get money, but you don't get games. but what if we could have
				the same situation but you get the games as well…
			</p>
			<p>
				i don't, however, pirate indie games. AAA studios are big enough to
				stand up for themselves; but indie studios, particularly those
				pushing the genre envelope, need all the help they can get
			</p>
			<p>
				i don't even pirate epic exclusive indie games. i'll wait until
				they come to steam. as much as i dislike epic, it's the smart
				business decision to accept their offers, and i don't think devs
				should be punished for that
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				but don't take the word of some internet schmuck;
				<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/harvard-lawyers-dont-think-that-piracy-is-theft-research-finds-220626/">
					take the word of several internet schmucks
				</a>
			</p>
			<footer>
				†however, even if i've persuaded you with this piece, i encourage
				you to form your own conclusions on what you consider acceptable
				piracy

			<h2>opinion: i don't think dark souls† should have an easy mode</h2>

			<p><strong>not for the reasons you think! hear me out!</strong></p>
			<p>
				i don't believe there is any value in being good at games, nor
				should one gatekeep those who like to enjoy a good power-fantasy.
			</p>
			<p>hear me out:</p>
			<h3>i don't believe ds <em>should</em> have an easy mode</h3>

			<p>
				not every piece of media is for everyone - i don't go into a cinema
				showing a rom-com, and complain about the lack of guns'n'ammo; i
				don't read <q>the life and times of winston churchill</q> and
				complain about the lack of greatsword wielding; i don't play
				amnesia and complain about the abundance of jump-scares.
			</p>
			<p>in the same vein, not every game is for everyone, and that's okay!
				if you're put off by ds' difficulty, there are plenty of other
				great games out there.
				<br />
				some (slightly easier) similar games worth playing:
				<ul>
					<li>hellpoint</li>
					<li>mortal shell</li>
					<li>code vein</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/23067">nose</a>
						<small>
							(yes it's a blatant knock-off, but it's
							<em>really</em> good)
						</small>
					</li>
					<li>jedi: fallen order
						<small>(more like sekiro, but you get the picture)</small>
					</li>
					<li>mortem: fallen kingdom</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				i never finished sekiro, because either i found it too hard, or the
				combat just didn't click for me. this does not mean i think sekiro
				is a bad game! it's just not for me
			</p>
			<h3>i believe ds should <em>not</em> have an easy mode</h3>

			<p>
				the difficulty in ds isn't just a gameplay element. it's a
				worldbuilding element. in ds, you are an undead on level footing
				with every other undead out there. the only thing keeping you from
				going hollow is your tenacity to push on and gain strength. if you
				were a force-wielding jedi, the story beats would feel (please
				excuse the pun) completely hollow.
			</p>
			<p>
				this does *not* extend to all souls-likes. i think souls-likes as a
				genre, should mostly have difficulty options. this is just about
				dark souls specifically and how it sets up its world.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<p>
				this does not apply to mods. i think all games should be moddable,
				and i don't think this matters in this case as mods have an
				inherent "unnofficiality" to them that make it plain that "this is
				not the intended way to play". but i think having a difficulty
				option in the main menu i fear would lead to many people trying the
				game, thinking "this is too hard", and completely missing the
				entire point of the game.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				that was all a bit controversial, so have a cat:

			<h2>css is like a zachtronics game, really</h2>
			<p>
				right. unlike a zt game, it's bollocks. it's inconsistent,
				confusing, and seemingly random.	it's clearly been designed by
				multiple people over decades, each with adifferent goal in mind.
				there are at least 6 different ways of centring items, depending
				upon its direction and parent.
				<br />
				off the top of my head:
				<ul>
					<li><code>
						<span style="color: var(--s-grn);">align-items</span>:
						<span style="color: var(--s-ppl);">center</span>;
					</code></li>
					<li><code>
						<span style="color: var(--s-grn);">margin</span>:
						<span style="color: var(--s-ppl);">0 auto</span>;
					</code></li>
					<li><code>
						<span style="color: var(--s-grn);">text-align</span>:
						<span style="color: var(--s-ppl);">center</span>;
					</code></li>
					<li><code>
						<span style="color: var(--s-grn);">justify content</span>:
						<span style="color: var(--s-ppl);">center</span>;
					</code></li>
					<li><code>
						<span style="color: var(--s-grn);">vertical-align</span>:
						<span style="color: var(--s-ppl);">middle</span>;</code>
						<small><i>/* why is this one not center? */</i></small>
					</li>
					<li><code>
						<span style="color: var(--s-grn);">transform</span>:
						<span style="color: var(--s-ppl);">translate(0, -50%)</span>;
					</code></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				however, just like opus magnum, there is no "right" solution. i
				personally loathe flexbox, but think grid is so intuitive and
				lovely. just as mentioned in
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toD5D6PDofU&t=1132s">
					this video,</a>
				one can either meet the targets of clarity, concision, or ease /
				time to finish; but not all three simultaneously. all code is
				hard to read when it's written by someone else, but css i find
				particularly hard compared to its ease of understanding at the time
				of writing, especially as it requires holding 2+ files in ones head
				(as the structure of the related html file is important, as well
				as possible js files).
			</p>
			<p>
				and to be honest, that's fun. trying to figure out the "best" way
				to solve this puzzle, for æsthetics & maintainability, is just as
				good as TIS-100, and it's free! <em>and</em> you get something out
				of it at the end (more than just a steam achievement, at least)
