			i know this tower is <em>very</em> teeny at
			the moment, but it's not really finished yet…
		</p>
		<p>
			this concept was the brainchild of Key's Klubhouse, read more about it
			<a href="https://keysklubhouse.neocities.org/teenytowers.html">here</a>
			<br />
			rules from that site:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You must follow the template for room size, floor level, and general scale. Please also keep the border color the same shade. You may build as many rooms as you please!
				</li>
				<li>
					Your room can be as simple or as complex as you like, provided it fits the dimensions. Animation is absolutely allowed! Additionally, you may combine a maximum of two rooms side-by-side without a border between (to make one large room).
				</li>
				<li>
					<s>Keep it PG! We're a family-friendly organization!</s><sup>2</sup>
				</li>
				<li>
					Much like other adoptable games, you may 'adopt' other builder's rooms, combining them with the provided lobby, elevator, vacancy and rooftop sign tiles to build your tower.
				</li>
				<li>
					Remember to link all rooms back to their builder's site!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>

				<sup>1</sup>template room by key:
				<br />
				<img src="/stadt/assets/images/towers/template.png" alt="room template layout" />
				<br />
				The door and windows are examples only; you can use them or change
				them or omit them entirely, it's up to you!
			</p>
			<p>
				<sup>2</sup>unlike key, i'm perfectly happy to accept explicit
				images, but if you make one bear in mind other sites might not be
			</p>
			<p>
				<sup>3</sup>feel free to use any of my images, or make your own:

				<img src="/stadt/assets/images/towers/structure/roofsign.png" alt="a tiny neon sign reading 'TEENY TOWERS' (the 'N' is dying)" />
			</p>
			<p>
				teeny towers was conceptualised by key, and inspired by the now
				defunct <a>honey building</a>
			</p>
			<p>(bonus points if you know what tower this was inspired by)</p>
