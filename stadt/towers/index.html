				welcome to my teeny towers page! i can't be arsed to write a
				description yet, so i'll temporarily plaguerise key's one:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Welcome to Teeny Towers, an ever-growing residential and commercial building where you can 'build' your own rooms and swap with other builders to add to your tower. If you'd like to move in or start a business here, all you have to do is follow a few simple rules!
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You must follow the template for room size, floor level, and general scale. Please also keep the border color the same shade. You may build as many rooms as you please!
					</li>
					<li>
						Your room can be as simple or as complex as you like, provided it fits the dimensions. Animation is absolutely allowed! Additionally, you may combine a maximum of two rooms side-by-side without a border between (to make one large room).
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep it PG! We're a family-friendly organization!
					</li>
					<li>
						Much like other adoptable games, you may 'adopt' other builder's rooms, combining them with the provided lobby, elevator, vacancy and rooftop sign tiles to build your tower.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remember to link all rooms back to their builder's site!
					</li>
				</ul>

					The door and windows are examples only; you can use them or change them or omit them entirely, it's up to you!

					the cafe was designed by sunny, all other templates designed (to
					my knowledge by key). roof sign designed by me
				<p>
					Teeny Towers was inspired by the now-defunct Honey Building!

				this tower is <em>very</em> teeny at the moment, as it's not really
				finished yet. nonetheless, <strong>you</strong> could still take a
				room - early birds get the top floor(s)!
