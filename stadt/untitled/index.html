			having finally finished bloodborne, i figured it was about time i put
			this up: a fanpage for the three best games from software have made
			<ol>
				<li>Dark Souls [Remastered]</li>
				<li>Dark Souls II [SotFS]</li>
				<li>Demon's Souls [Original]</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h2>Dark Souls</h2>
		<p>

		</p>
		<h2>Demon's Souls</h2>
		<p>
			very close to being the best game fromsoft have made. despite being the
			lowest budget and the game predicted to fail, it has the best lore, the
			most interesting story, and the most enthralling & cohesive world design:
		</p>
		<p>
			want upgrade ore? head to the mines. want healing items? kill soldiers in
			the castle. want souls? head the the ethereal shrine of storms. only game
			apart from elden ring that makes sense in this way
		</p>
		<p>
			the game that started the annoying runbacks in souls games, but the only
			game in which the runbacks are actually good: in demon's souls, the
			bosses aren't in anyway difficult, they're more of a puzzle than a combat
			trial. the combat comes in the form of navigating the enemies, who are
			placed in such a way that they have to be fought. no more tedious dashing
			past enemies like in later games; every boss attempt requires enjoyable
			engagement
		</p>
		<p>
			it would be the best fromsoft game if it weren't for a few major flaws,
			that from have since fixed with later games:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				having to endure a loading screen to travel back to the nexus every
				time one wants to level up
			</li>
			<li>
				having to worry about running out of healing, every time you die is â‰¥1
				grass wasted. estus is a much better system
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Here be <del>Dragons</del> <ins>Negativity</ins></h2>
		<p>
			i'm worried from might not make another good game. elden ring was a step
			in the right direction, but it is so far from their hayday that it's
			almost worth discounting. observe this graph:
		</p>
		<img src="/stadt/assets/images/renameme/fromsoft.svg"
			class="indent-9x fullwidth-graph"
			alt="chart showing a bell curve of from software's quality, peaking with
				dark souls 1" />
		<p>
			bear in mind this was not the order in which i played them, this shape
			started to form subconsciously in my head and it was not until elden ring
			broke the trend that i noticed it. bloodborne is (as of
			<time>2022-11-24</time>) the most recent game that i played, and it
			perfectly fitted into its slot (between ds2 & ds3, but much closer to the
			latter)
		</p>
		<p>
			frankly it's shameful that the so called "b team" can do so much better
			a job than the a team. maybe miyazaki is the problem?
