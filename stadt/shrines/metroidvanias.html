			Now, this isn't the sort of niche franchise i'd normally like to draw
			attention to – i'm sure most everyone has heard of metroid, and probably
			played at least one – but i have a couple of unusual opinions on
			particular entries that i feel people should appreciate more (yes,
			including that one)

		<h2>Super Metroid</h2>
		<p>
			I'm not sure there's much i need to say about <i>super</i>. If you've
			played any metroid, you'll have played <i>super</i>. If you haven't,
			start here. If you have, and haven't played <i>super</i> – <em>why?</em>

		<p>
			Look, i know everyone loves to hate <i>other m</i>. But after playing it,
			i can only assume that most people who mock it online haven't actually
			played it. It's not the best metroid game, but heck it's honestly pretty
			good and i think more people should play it
		</p>
		<p>
			It may not be as open as some metroid games, but it does have a
			certain amount of puzzle-solving/secret-finding. But more importantly, it
			just feels really nice to play? being the progenitor of the
			flashy movement in <i>samus returns</i>/<i>dread</i>, it feels so
			smooth and yet precise compared to the sprite-based metroids.
			Samus' movement has always been a little weird (in super, for example,
			ones standing jump is not quite as high as ones spin jump. This is very
			annoying.), but in <i>other m</i> i think it might be the second nicest in
			the whole series, after <i>dread</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			It may make it a little too easy (Yes it does. It's an incredibly easy
			game. Too easy, some might say.), but the auto-aiming is really nice.
			Aiming in sprite-based metroids was always a little awkward. I mean in
			nestroid most enemies were 1 tile high, and therefore completely
			unshootable – yes it got better from there, but one was always limited to
			45° until <i>samus returns</i>. The auto-aiming just makes the whole game
			so fluid
		</p>
		<p>
			The boss fights (such as they are, i'm including mini-bosses as otherwise
			the game has i think …3?) are so fast-paced as well. <i>Nightmare</i>
			was the point in <i>fusion</i> that i realised exactly why i didn't like
			that game, whereas <i>nightmare</i> in <i>other m</i> is actually a really
			good boss. Not one boss fight takes longer than <del>about a minute</del>
			¿i think?,
			and they're frantic bursts of a mini-puzzle and execution-check blended
			together so well.
			<ins>This isn't true, i just remembered the fucking forklift. But apart
			from that one, they're good</ins>
		</p>
		<p>
			Look, i'm not going to deny it has its flaws. <strong>Plenty of
			them.</strong> But i do think that its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.
			There's an old phrase that <q>players know what they
			don't like, but are wrong about the solutions</q>.
			I think a lot of many people's complaints are a little
			misplaced:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><q>The story's bad</q></dt>
			<dd><p>
				The execution is. It's really, really bad. The writing is bad, the voice
				acting is worse, and the inner monologue is a perfect storm combining
				the two
			</p>
			<p>
				But i don't think the high concept is necessarily bad. It's a direction
				for samus' character that i personally don't like, and it's incongruous
				with her previous characterisation in the prime series (although it's
				not <em>too</em> out of keeping with fusion); but i think in isolation
				it's not too bad a concept to consider samus' feelings
				toward <mark>an engineered bioweapon:</mark>
				the metroid she <em>disobeyed her mission brief to save</em> – souring
				her relationship with the galactic federation – and which later saved
				her life against mother brain; and consider it via the allegory of
				<mark>an engineered bioweapon:</mark> an artificial intelligence
				designed to control other bioform weapons and the parental feelings
				toward it by its creator
			</p></dd>
			<dt><q>It's too linear to be a metroid game</q></dt>
			<dd><p>
				Despite their reputation, and the genre named after them, the mainline
				metroid games aren't really <em>that</em> non-linear…? nestroid
				obviously is, as are super and the prime series
			</p>
			<p>
				But <i>other m</i> is probably
				on a par with <i>II</i>, <i>zero mission</i>, and to a lesser extent
				<i>samus returns</i>. In fact, it's probably <em>less</em> linear than
				<i>fusion</i>.
				That's over half the metroid series at the point it came out. If you
				approach it as a metroidvania, it's restricting. If you approach it as a
				metroid game, it's fine. Would it be improved by removing all the
				unnecessarily locked doors? I think so, yes. But on the other hand you'd
				be more likely to get lost, so it's not a blanket improvement. I do wish
				there was an option for that though, even if as a hard mode after one
				playthrough, à la <i>fusion mode</i>
			</p></dd>
			<dt><q>The controls are bad</q></dt>
			<dd><p>
				I mean yeah, probably? it was on the fucking wii! that thing has about
				as many buttons as a fucking NES! i played it with a ds5, which i think
				was the ideal controller for it: soft mushy dpad for smooth movement,
				enough buttons for all situations, and decent gyro for aim mode.
				Yes, it would have been improved by nunchuck support, but i imagine
				they were trying to reduce the barrier to entry by not requiring it
			</p></dd>
			<dt><q>3D movement needs an analogue stick</q></dt>
			<dd><p>
				Related to the previous complaint, but i want to address it separately
				as i have opinions™. Yes, this sounds bad on paper, but i think team
				ninja dealt with it <strong>really well</strong>. I mapped the analogue
				stick to movement (digital only though) on my controller, but i kept
				drifting back to using the dpad. At almost every point you want to be
				either moving sideways (like a traditional metroid) or directly away
				away from the camera. This makes the cardinal movement feel really nice,
				and i actually <em>much</em> prefer it to the analogue only 2d movement
				in <i>samus returns</i>/<i>dread</i>
			</p></dd>
			<dt><q>The search view sections are dumb</q></dt>
			<dd><p>
				Yeah. They are. They're <strong><em>really</em></strong> bad. Being
				locked into position and having to pixel hunt <em>without even knowing
				what one's hunting for</em>is such a fucking stupid idea i can't believe
				it made it into the final game. The ones nearest the beginning are the
				worst though for some reason? if you can suffer through
				<ol style="display: inline-block; list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
					<li><a href="https://metroid.retropixel.net/games/metroidom/searchview.php#:~:text=Segment%20%233,area">
						searching for something
						genuinely so hidden i thought my game had softlocked. I had to
						fucking google it. It was completely invisible, hidden behind a
						plant; and
					</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://metroid.retropixel.net/games/metroidom/searchview.php#:~:text=Segment%20%237,Creature">
						the game starting you off facing the wrong way and facing something
						ostensibly much more important – <spoiler>a dead squad
						member</spoiler> – and expects you to turn 180° and look at a random
						bit of green splat on some green grass
					</a></li>
				</ol>
				then after that, they're not too bad. Still a fucking dumb
				concept though.
			</p></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			well now i feel like i've ended on a sour note, as there are some major
			missteps with this game. But i do really like it! the minute to minute
			gameplay is genuinely really fun! there are a
			<a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/metroid-other-m-redux-based-on-maxximum-edition.602301/">couple</a>
			of
			<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/6msbxg/other_m_maxximum_edition_fix_hack_first_release/">mods</a> to
			remove/revamp the story cutscenes, though i haven't tried them as i wanted
			to experience the game in its original form out of interest (will
			probably try redux at some point though). I did however use
			<a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/new-classic-controller-hacks.659837/page-2#post-10491796">this
			gecko code</a>, along with a
			<a href="/stadt/assets/other/Metroid-Other-M.ini" download>custom
			controller layout</a> (diagramme coming soon)
