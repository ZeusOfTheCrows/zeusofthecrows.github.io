				i've just seen this image on <a href="mothcore.neocities.org/">
				mothcore's site</a>, and it really reminds me of a time when the dw
				writers absolutely didn't have a clue what they were doing, but
				they did their best anyways. and i think that's wonderful.

			<p>"tardis calling"? what the fuck? why not "doctor calling"? i have
				no idea what they were thinking

				<span class="captioned" title="or you won't, i don't know you">
				you'll notice</span> most images on this site are apng, not gifs or
				webp. according to <a href="http://littlesvr.ca/apng/gif_apng_webp2.html">
				this site</a>, they're notably better. bearing in mind webp doesn't
				support indexed colour modes, driving up the filesize. in my
				experience, there's very little between apng & webp; but apng
				aren't made by google
