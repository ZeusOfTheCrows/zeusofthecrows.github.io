## Static Sites

Because I like digital archæology: a bunch of websites that I think hark back to the classic internet of everyone having a nice basic personal page with little to no JS, basic CSS, and a bunch of info/tastes. Also, I like the concept of the classic, interconnected internet. for more extreme examples, see [cities](/web/cities)

I bear no responsibility for the contents of these pages, I just thought they were cool.

Also, for the sites not in your native language, I recommend [this firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/traduzir-paginas-web/); and sites no longer online I recommend [this one](https://github.com/dessant/web-archives).
