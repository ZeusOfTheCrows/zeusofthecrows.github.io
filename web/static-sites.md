## Static Sites

Because I like digital arch√¶ology: a bunch of websites that I think hark back to the classic internet of everyone having a nice basic personal page with little to no JS, basic CSS, and a bunch of info/tastes. Also, I like the concept of the classic, interconnected internet.

I bear no responsibility for the contents of these pages, I just thought they were cool.

Also, for the sites not in your native language, I recommend [this firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/traduzir-paginas-web/); and sites no longer online I recommend [this one](https://github.com/dessant/web-archives).

- [antnik](https://antnik.wordpress.com/): Some **gorgeous** pictures of retro computers [Greek].
  - JS: heavy, mostly boilerplate wordpress stuff
- [int10h](https://int10h.org/): Retro PC based stuff; great collection of bitmap-type fonts. Yes the homepage is ugly, but the font page is what I would like this site to look like, were I talented.

- [jgarza](http://jgarza.sdf.org/): Also some fun [pictures of computers](http://jgarza.sdf.org/MUSEUM/museum.php).
  - JS: none?
- [searchlores](http://biostatisticien.eu/www.searchlores.org/words.htm#top): The most bizarre site on this list, and it may require the use of [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/) to browse. [Root is open though](http://biostatisticien.eu/www.searchlores.org/).
  - JS: none?

- [tweakradje](https://sites.google.com/site/tweakradje/): A whole collection of interesting tweaks and such pertaining to Android/Windows.
  - JS: high, it's a google site and has embedded youtube
