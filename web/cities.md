## Neo/Geo cities

i vaguely knew about neocities (a revival of the geocities vibe) before now, but i've only just started browsing them properly. i probably should have created this site with them; but i'm used to ghp/jekyll now. ~i hope to join a webring maybe perhaps at some point~, **i have now joined two webrings, yesterweb & geekring** although the widget would go against my "no JS" policy…

anyways, i'll link some of my favourites and those i feel truly encapsulate the 00's here, with gifs to keep the nostalgic style. i'm sure there are  more great sites out there, but i haven't found them yet

this page will probably be quite volatile as i don't want it getting too long, so 'sites may be culled periodically…
