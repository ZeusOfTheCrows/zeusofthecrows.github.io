## Neo/Geo cities

i vaguely knew about neocities (a revival of the geocities vibe) before now, but i've only just started browsing them properly. i probably should have created this site with them; but i'm used to ghp/jekyll now. i hope to join a webring maybe perhaps at some point, although the widget would go against my "no JS" policy…

anyways, i'll link some of my favourites here, with gifs to keep the nostalgic style. i'm sure there are  more great sites out there, but i haven't found them yet

- [![Bill's World](https://billsworld.neocities.org/images/billsworld.gif){: .gc-button}](https://billsworld.neocities.org/): virtual (iframe) web browser with netscape UI (reasonably performance heavy)
- [![devils.exe](https://66.media.tumblr.com/777717d122b4e7d3ae82524b44d21f67/tumblr_inline_pswuk76Sda1w1xdc5_1280.gif){: .gc-button}](https://devils.neocities.org/): very pretty 1bit style site. most objects are interactive.
- [![EMPTY GØD](https://emptygod.neocities.org/buttongraphic/buttons/emptygod.gif.gif){: .gc-button}](https://emptygod.neocities.org/): edgy and depressive - introduced me to a new artist ([Mr.Kitty](https://emptygod.neocities.org/mrkitty.html))
- [![Quartz OSC Chip](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/blinkies/imissxp.gif){: .gc-button}](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/about.html/): a nice site with a half decent [gallery](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/gallery.html) (i couldn't find a button, so i had to choose one)

* ![Zeus' Button](/assets/images/web/cities/button.gif){: .gc-button}: as i'm linking these with gif buttons, i guess i should create my own.3
* ![Zeus' Button green version](/assets/images/web/cities/button-green.gif){: .gc-button}: i prefer amber terminals, but here's a green version if you like^

here's an attempt; using web safe colours, no transparency, and 10hz for the authentic feel. the font is [tiny mono](/other/fonts#various-pixelfonts), modified for with fixedsys slashes. the piskel file is [here](/assets/images/web/cities/button.piskel), ^feel free to request (or make) a version themed to your 'site.
