## Neo/Geo cities

i vaguely knew about neocities (a revival of the geocities vibe) before now, but i've only just started browsing them properly. i probably should have created this site with them; but i'm used to ghp/jekyll now. i hope to join a webring maybe perhaps at some point, although the widget would go against my "no JS" policy…

anyways, i'll link some of my favourites and those i feel truly encapsulate the 00's here, with gifs to keep the nostalgic style. i'm sure there are  more great sites out there, but i haven't found them yet

## Sites

- [![Bill's World](https://billsworld.neocities.org/images/billsworld.gif){: .gc-button}](https://billsworld.neocities.org/): virtual (iframe) web browser with netscape UI (reasonably performance heavy)

- [![EMPTY GØD](https://emptygod.neocities.org/buttongraphic/buttons/emptygod.gif.gif){: .gc-button}](https://emptygod.neocities.org/): edgy and depressive - introduced me to a new artist ([Mr.Kitty](https://emptygod.neocities.org/mrkitty.html))

- [![Quartz OSC Chip](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/blinkies/imissxp.gif){: .gc-button}](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/): a nice site with a half decent [gallery](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/gallery.html) (ironically, i couldn't find a button)

## Webrings

* [Geekring](http://geekring.net/site/6/frameset): ztodo add descript. 
* [JAUP](https://www.geocities.ws/jaup/jaup.htm): not really a ring, but a list of pages of a similar calibre

* ![Zeus' Button](/assets/images/web/cities/button.gif){: .gc-button}: as i'm linking these with gif buttons, i guess i should create my own.
* ![Zeus' Button green version](/assets/images/web/cities/button-green.gif){: .gc-button}: i prefer amber (as one can tell), but here's a green version if you like^

here's an attempt; using web safe colours, no transparency, and 5hz for the authentic feel. the font is [tiny mono](/other/fonts#various-pixelfonts), modified with fixedsys slashes. the piskel file is [here](/assets/images/web/cities/button.piskel), ^feel free to request (or make) a version themed to your 'site.
