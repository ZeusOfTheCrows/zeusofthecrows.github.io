## Neo/Geo cities

i vaguely knew about neocities (a revival of the geocities vibe) before now, but i've only just started browsing them properly. i probably should have created this site with them; but i'm used to ghp/jekyll now. i hope to join a webring maybe perhaps at some point, although the widget would go against my "no JS" policy…

anyways, i'll link some of my favourites and those i feel truly encapsulate the 00's here, with gifs to keep the nostalgic style. i'm sure there are  more great sites out there, but i haven't found them yet

this page will probably be quite volatile as i don't want it getting too long, so 'sites may be culled periodically…

## 'Sites

|  |  |
|---|---|
| [![Bill's World](/assets/images/web/cities/bills-world.gif){: .gc-button}](https://billsworld.neocities.org/) | virtual (iframe) web browser with netscape UI (reasonably performance heavy). |
| [![Cameron's World](/assets/images/web/cities/cams-world.png){: .gc-button}](https://www.cameronsworld.net/) | truly hideous in the best possible way. also, chill midi tunes (but no button? i had to choose one from the page and it's bigger than 88×31). |
| [![devils.exe](/assets/images/web/cities/devils.gif){: .gc-button}](https://devils.neocities.org/) | very pretty 1bit style 'site. most objects are interactable. |
| [![EMPTY GØD](/assets/images/web/cities/empty-god.gif){: .gc-button}](https://emptygod.neocities.org/) | edgy and depressive - introduced me to a new artist ([Mr.Kitty](https://emptygod.neocities.org/mrkitty.html)). |
| [![madville](/assets/images/web/cities/madville.gif){: .gc-button}](https://madville.neocities.org/) | ztodo add descript. maybe?|
| [![meso](/assets/images/web/cities/meso.gif){: .gc-button}](https://mesoscale.neocities.org//) | whole bunch of cool stuff, some great badge/stamp art, nice music (top middle was my choice). just a pretty good 'site all around. |
| [![Neonauticon](/assets/images/web/cities/neonaut.png){: .gc-button}](https://neonaut.neocities.org/) | ztodo add descript. lots of interesting stuff. large list of [button gifs.](https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31.html) |
| [![sadness](/assets/images/web/cities/sadness.gif){: .gc-button}](https://sadgrl.online/about/) | she was the catalyst for this page! if you only visit one site on this list, _let it be [this one.](https://sadgrl.online/newoldweb/surftheweb.html)_ |
| [![Quartz OSC Chip](/assets/images/web/cities/quartz-osc.gif){: .gc-button}](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/) | a nice 'site with a half decent [gallery](https://quartzosc-chip.neocities.org/gallery.html) (ironically, i couldn't find a button). |
| [![violet radd](/assets/images/web/cities/violet-radd.gif){: .gc-button}](https://violetradd.com/) | very pretty, i also liked the comic on the front page (at time of writing). |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Zeus' Button](/assets/images/button.gif){: .gc-button}     | as i'm linking these with gif buttons, i guess i should create my own. |
| ![Zeus' Button green version](/assets/images/button-green.gif){: .gc-button} | i prefer amber (as one can tell), but here's a green version if you like^ |

using web safe colours, no transparency, and 5hz for the authentic feel. the font is [tiny mono](/other/fonts#various-pixelfonts), modified with fixedsys slashes. the piskel file is [here](/assets/images/web/cities/button.piskel), ^feel free to request (or make) a version themed to your 'site.
