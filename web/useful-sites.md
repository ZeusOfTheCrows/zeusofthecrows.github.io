## Useful Sites

**this page has been deprecated, and will soon be moved to the [stadt](/stadt/)**

Some useful websites I've stumbled upon during my rovings of the internet. some of these rather push the definition of useful, but i didn't know how else to categorise them.

I bear no responsibility for the contents of these pages, I just thought they were cool.

Also, for the sites not in your native language, I recommend [this firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/traduzir-paginas-web/).
