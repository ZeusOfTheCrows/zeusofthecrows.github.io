## Useful Sites

Some useful websites I've stumbled upon during my rovings of the internet.

I bear no responsibility for the contents of these pages, I just thought they were cool.

Also, for the sites not in your native language, I recommend [this firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/traduzir-paginas-web/).

- [dlanham](https://dlanham.com/): **Beautiful** art and animation, most is available as [paid] wallpapers.
- [signalnoise](https://signalnoise.com/): more art, this time of a synthwave flavour. this site introduced me to several bands, and encouraged me to watch drive.

- [sensefulsolutions](http://www.sensefulsolutions.com/): “Tech solutions that make sense.”
- [xahlee](http://xahlee.info/): Of course I had to include Xah Lee. Whilst I disagree with him on a surprising number of points, I appreciate what he does.
- [radiotower](http://radiotower.su/): Soviet themed internet radio [[Playlists](http://listen.radiotower.su:8000/)]
- [door2windows](http://www.door2windows.com/): Bunch of customisation programmes for Windows.
- [windowscustomization](https://windowscustomization.com/): Repository of various Windows themes/theming tools.
