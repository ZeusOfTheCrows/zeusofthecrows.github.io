## Bookmarks

A bunch of websites that I think hark back to the classic internet of everyone having a nice basic personal page with little to no JS, basic CSS, and a bunch of info/tastes. Also, I like the concept of the classic, interconnected internet.

I bear no responsibility for the contents of these pages, I just thought they were cool.

Also, for the sites not in your native language, I recommend [this firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/traduzir-paginas-web/).

## Personal sites

[antnik](https://antnik.wordpress.com/): Some **gorgeous** pictures of retro computers. [Greek]

[dlanham](https://dlanham.com/): **Beautiful** art and animation, most is available as [paid] wallpapers.

[searchlores](http://biostatisticien.eu/www.searchlores.org/words.htm#top): The most bizarre site on this list, and it may require the use of [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/) to browse. [Root is open though](http://biostatisticien.eu/www.searchlores.org/).

[searchlore](https://www.searchlore.org/): Similar to above, but a bit more modern. _May_ be run by the same person?

[sensefulsolutions](http://www.sensefulsolutions.com/): “Tech solutions that make sense.”

[sensi](http://sensi.org/): Parent site to [svo](#svo). Full of interesting stuff, personal websites, email archives, etc. [Mostly Russian]

[ssokolow](http://ssokolow.com/): Linux and DOS stuff - most interesting stuff is on his [blog](http://blog.ssokolow.com/).

[svo](http://sensi.org/~svo/): Exactly what I mean in terms of classic internet. Made a [great version](http://sensi.org/~svo/glasstty/) of the DEC VT220 font. [Russian]

[tweakradje](https://sites.google.com/site/tweakradje/): A whole collection of interesting tweaks and such pertaining to Android/Windows.

[webonastick](https://webonastick.com/): Mainly because he makes a [really nice font](https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/).

[wunkolo](https://wunkolo.github.io/): Probably the youngest site on my list, mainly low-level/graphics stuff. I found it through [this piece on gifs](https://wunkolo.github.io/).

[xahlee](http://xahlee.info/): Of course I had to include Xah Lee. Whilst I disagree with him on a surprising number of points, I appreciate what he does.
