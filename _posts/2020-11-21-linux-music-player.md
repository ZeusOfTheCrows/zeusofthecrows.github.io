If anyone does know a music player for linux that's anywhere near as good as musicbee, _please_ do tell me.

---

**What I'm looking for:**

_Necessaria:_
* Tracks View (I would have thought this was standard, but a surprising number of players don't have it)
* Sync with phone (two way sync preferable)
* Customisable hotkeys
* Multiple artists/genres delimited by ;
* Stop at end of track 
* file reorganisation (automatically move songs to music\artist\artist-track.mp3)

_Optimala:_
* Customise layout (queue on right)
* Now playing screen with queue
* Auto-tag from internet
* Dynamically generated playlist
* Miniplayer
* Tabbed interface with menubar below
* Customise double click action (add to queue, rather than play immediately)

**Players I have already tried**

* Rhythmbox
* Clementine
* Strawberry
* DeaDBeeF
* Lollypop
* Quod Libet (this is the closest I have tried; and my favourite so far, but doesn't integrate with cinnamon's panel, among other things)
* Others I can't remember, but will add later
