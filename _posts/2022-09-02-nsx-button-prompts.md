i now have enough of these mods to group them together,  and i've decided to do
so on a github repo

i know it's not what git is designed for (it's mostly images), but it allows me
to host the packed zip files in the releases tab. also, i wanted a mirror apart
from nexus,  as that requires an account to download mods, and i couldn't think
of any other way
