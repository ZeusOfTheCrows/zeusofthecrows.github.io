i made this quite a while ago now, but i clearly have absolutely no application, so i've only just got around to putting a page for it up on this site:

**i made a mod for alternative button prompts on the steam deck**

[as you can tell](stadt/thoughts#abxy), i prefer the nintendo layout, so i wanted to have the snes prompts on my deck; but i thought to avoid others having to make a similar mod i'd do some playstation ones at the same time

therefore, if you have a steam deck with [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) installed, get yourself the [CSS Loader](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader) plugin and [enjoy the proper icons on your deck](/utilities/steam-deck/)
