thanks to a [page on neocities](https://sadgrl.online/newoldweb/surftheweb.html) i've recently learnt of the the existence of webrings, and thought them such a good idea that i promptly applied to two of them: as such, i'm grateful to join the fold of [yesterweb](https://yesterweb.neocities.org/), and [geekring](http://geekring.net/).

i will be adding these [to the sidebar, I think?], so please give them some love if you get the chance.

for more info on webrings, and things of a similar calibre, [see here](/web/cities/)
