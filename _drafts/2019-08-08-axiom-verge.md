Opening Excerpt

<!--more-->

------

Ah, Metroidvanias. The game genre in which one spends half an hour trying to make "that jump", then finding the upgrade needed to make it easy. Now, I’ll probably annoy some people with this, but I've never played the original Metroid games - I played a little of the first one, and I must say I wasn’t a huge fan of it. The controls were awkward (albeit the controller only had six buttons), the enemies moved somewhat weirdly, and the lack of modern conveniences such as a map made it feel like a slog.

===========================================================================================

I am somewhat tired of pixel art - I realise it's quick and easy which is good for indie developers, but there are a lot of pixel art games around

Lovely gritty colour palette



Lots of enemy variety - random swoopers

Really interesting music - I'm a sucker for good chiptune, and the early boss music is exactly that, bit it gets much more diverse later on

Great sound design - noise of doing damage consistently different to doing none - beep of low health in time to music

It doesn't do very much new, but what it does it does very well. And yes, maybe I'm biased in favour of a game made by one person, but I'm biased as hell anyway

Story is competent, but not revolutionary

Being a sort of glass cannon forces you to fight enemies rather than just rush past them

Let me make this clear: had I seen this on Kickstarter, I wouldn't have backed it. Even if it had gameplay videos, which get me much more interested than a pre-rendered trailer, it just looks like "yet another pixel-art metroidvania".

[+] An adorable handcrafted world

[+] An interesting and well designed world that sucks you in to explore it

[+] Lovely chilled background music

[+] Cute little puzzles

[+] Charming and interesting characters

------

[-] The controls, but I guess that’s just a personal qualm

[-] The story I can barely even criticise, it just wasn’t there

[-] A few minor stability issues

**You should play this if: you like point &amp; click games, arty and attractive games, or noticeably indie passion projects**
