		</p>

		<section id="des">
			<h2>Demon's Souls</h2>
			<p>
				very close to being the best game fromsoft have made. despite being the
				lowest budget and the game predicted to fail, it has the best lore, the
				most interesting story, and the most enthralling & cohesive world
				design:
			</p>
			<p>
				want upgrade ore? head to the mines. want healing items? kill soldiers
				in the castle. want souls? head the the ethereal shrine of storms.
				only game apart from elden ring that makes sense in this way
			</p>
			<figure class="img-aside right" style="--rot: 10deg">
				<img src="/stadt/assets/images/stamps/demons.png"
					alt="demon's souls stamp"
					data-img-src="https://www.deviantart.com/arconte/art/stamp-demons-souls-160629029" />
			</figure>
			<p>
				the game that started the annoying runbacks in souls games, but the
				only game in which the runbacks are actually good: in demon's souls,
				the bosses aren't in any way difficult, they're more of a puzzle than a
				combat trial. the combat comes in the form of navigating the enemies,
				who are placed in such a way that they have to be fought. no more
				tedious dashing past enemies like in later games; every boss attempt
				requires enjoyable engagement
			</p>
			<p>
				it would be the best fromsoft game if it weren't for a few major flaws,
				that from have since fixed with later games:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					having to endure a loading screen to travel back to the nexus every
					time one wants to level up, dump/upgrade items, travel to another
					area
				</li>
				<li>
					having to worry about running out of healing, every time you die is
					≥1 grass wasted. i hardly use any > half moon grass until i have the
					ring of regeneration
				</li>
				<li>
					the item burden system is stupid, and feels like it's only jammed in
					because every other rpg has one
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>valley of defilement sucks though</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				this section is solely about the ps3 original,
				as the 2020 bluepoint remake is soul-less (heh), generic and
				bland-looking
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="ds1">
			<h2>Dark Souls</h2>
			<p>
				shows that all these games proclaiming "fast-paced combat" oughtn't be
			</p>
			<p>
				the crowning glory of the soulsborne series. the environment design is
				almost on par with demon's souls; it's the only game i've ever played
				that feels like the map was designed to be used by residents rather than
				played as a game. in fact, everything about the game feels like it
				doesn't give a shit if you play it or not
			</p>
			<img src="/stadt/assets/images/opinions/onion.jpg"
				class="banner top outdent-9x"
				alt="our favourite onion boy thinking"
				data-img-src="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/y8eadt/dark_souls_reimagined_in_topdown_perspective_full/" />
			<p>
				it fixes all of demon's souls' major flaws: the estus system refils
				healing items every death; bonfires allow levelling, repairing equipment,
				and upgrading weapons; and the item burden has been removed entirely
			</p>
			<p>
				i almost don't have anything negative to say about it
			</p>
			<p>blighttown sucks though</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				this section is primarily about the remastered version,
				as that's the one i played,
				but this applies to the vanilla version as they're practically the same
				apart from performance issues
			</p>

				data-img-src="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/y8eadt/dark_souls_reimagined_in_topdown_perspective_full/" />
		</section>

		<section id="ds2">
			<h2>Dark Souls II</h2>
			<figure class="img-aside left" style="--rot: 345deg">
				<img src="/stadt/assets/images/stamps/darksoul.png"
					alt="majula stamp 'you died'"
					data-img-src="ɀeus" />
				<figcaption>
					y'know, given the pronunciation of "freja" and "najka", there's a
					non-zero
					chance that it's pronounced <span class="ipa">/mα'julə/</span>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				much more "fantastic" than des/ds1, with brighter colours than the
				sickly green of des or the washed out grunge of ds1. unfortunately,
				however i think means one loses the juxtaposition of the anor londo
				reveal.
				heide's tower of flame, for example, is just as pretty as anor londo,
				but i don't think it feels the same as it's not in comparison to the
				depths, blighttown, and then sen's fortress
			</p>
			<p>
				the slowest game in the series i think? but that allows it to be the
				hardest. rather than a pure test of reflexes, it's an actual test of
				strategy, game knowledge, and other skills. <!-- add more here -->
				i don't like the parry mechanic though. unlike ds1, there's a startup
				animation, which means that rather than parrying when the attack is
				about to land, one has to parry as soon as the attack animation starts
			</p>
			<img src="/stadt/assets/images/opinions/balrog.jpg"
				class="banner top outdent-9x"
				alt="'you shall not pass' old iron king"
				data-img-src="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/y8eadt/dark_souls_reimagined_in_topdown_perspective_full/" />
			<p>
				so many optional bosses and alternative routes! don't want to fight the
				bastard ruin sentinels? take a walk through a wall with a face! can't
				be arsed with the singeing demon? just disable the flames and climb the
				ladder!
				don't want to fight any of the four main bosses? just, like, don't
				bother!
			</p>
			<p>
				i think they realised ds1's mistakes about the runback being too boring,
				and tried to fix it. unfortunately it's not quite as good as des, as
				they did so by making enemies have a longer aggro range and mist gates
				have no i-frames rather than by pure
				enemy placement and environment design, but it's still pretty good
			</p>
			<p>the gutter sucks though</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				this section is primarily about the scholar of the first sin revision,
				as i feel that is the definitive version (enemy placements are more
				lore friendly, etc.),
				but a lot of this applies to the vanilla version as well
			</p>
		</section>

		<hr />

		<h2>Here be <del>Dragons</del> <ins>Negativity</ins></h2>
		<p>
			i'm worried from might not make another good game. elden ring was a step
			in the right direction, but it is so far from their hayday that it's
			almost worth discounting. observe this graph:
		</p>
		<img src="/stadt/assets/images/opinions/fromsoft.svg"
			class="indent-9x fullwidth-graph"
			alt="chart showing a bell curve of from software's quality, peaking with
				dark souls 1" />
		<p>
			bear in mind this was not the order in which i played them, this shape
			started to form subconsciously in my head and it was not until elden ring
			broke the trend that i noticed it. bloodborne is (as of
			<time>2022-11-24</time>) the most recent game that i played, and it
			perfectly fitted into its slot (between ds2 & ds3, but much closer to the
			latter)
		</p>
		<p>
			frankly it's shameful that the so called "b team" can do so much better
			a job than the a team. maybe miyazaki is the problem?
