<p>An absolutely incredible game; I cannot recommend it enough. Gorgeous graphics, amazing soundtrack, original mechanics, and one of the best stories I have ever encountered in gaming. One of my top five games of all time.</p>

<p>I thought I’d start this off with one of my favourite games. I know nobody will read this unless they decide to read through all of my stuff [reviews? comments? recommendations?] for posterity, but I’m going to do so anyway.</p>

<p>I’m a massive fan of Scandinavian games, as you’ll come to see, so Brothers wins points off the bat for being directed by a Swede, Josef Fares. It also wins points for the high fantasy setting, which I like when it’s done well.</p>

<p>Brothers is, I believe, the only example of “singleplayer co-op” as you play as two characters simultaneously. Other people I know have found this a little confusing, but I got to grips with it and found it a fairly intuitive control scheme. The store page claims it requires a controller, but it does in fact have okay keyboard controls. I played it with an Xbone controller. The camera controls are a bit odd, but I never had cause to use them, and one analogue stick for each character and triggers to interact seems to work fine for me.</p>

<p>The cell-shaded look makes the game age well - as it usually does - and for a game released in 2013 (that’s how on the ball these reviews are going to be) it still looks in my opinion much better than many games released this year. Add this to gorgeous environmental design, and the whole thing is just a visual treat even today.</p>

<p>The puzzles are pretty standard far for this type of game: a smaller, lither character for can fit through small gaps, and a stronger character who can swim and lift the younger brother up to higher places. But the game changes things up quite a bit, so one doesn’t really notice. From saving a troll, to avoiding forest wolves, to hang-gliding through a canyon, there’s a decent amount of gameplay variance. I’m trying to avoid spoilers as I believe this game is much better played, but that makes this section quite tricky to write.</p>

<p>It makes the next section even trickier. The story is based around going on a journey to find medicine for your father (I’m not afraid of spoiling this, it’s in the first five minutes) from a healing tree in a magical forest. This takes the eponymous brothers far away from the safety of the vilage they’ve grown up in; to, amongst other places, a forest of living branches, an abandoned village inhabited by an invisible monster, and an old giant’s battlefield. The story is purely conveyed through the environment and characters, with no dialogue at all apart from the brothers calling each others names.</p>

<p>This is a brilliant example of how to build a tale into a game, rather than tacking it on at the end, and really exemplifies the concept of video games as a narrative art form. Well worth playing if you’re even slightly into games.</p>

<hr />

<p>[+] Art design that holds up well and looks fantastic</p>

<p>[+] Unique, ingenuitive control scheme</p>

<p>[+] Story that ties into the gameplay, rather than just being a vessel</p>

<p>[+] Soundtrack that sits in the background, subtly enhancing the experience</p>

<hr />

<p>[-] Not much. Using the shoulder buttons for camera control, I guess?</p>
