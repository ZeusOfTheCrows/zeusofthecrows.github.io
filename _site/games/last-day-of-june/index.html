<p>A calm and peaceful - but <em>very</em> slow - game, possibly the best looking you’ll play in a long while.</p>

<!--more-->

<hr />

<p>At first glance, this looks like exactly my sort of game. Very pretty, very indie, and telling a slightly ambiguous story without any dialogue. At second glance, however, it seems to turn into a slowly written, third person walking sim with very little actual gameplay. As such, it really surprised me by absolutely winning me over by the end.</p>

<p>When I started this game, I thought it was going to be a feel good sort of thing, pottering about as Carl whilst his life goes well for him with his doting [Girlfriend? Wife? I’m not sure]. So I was very surprised when it became an odd time-travelling puzzle, changing the actions of various people to try to keep this apparently absurdly accident prone man alive.</p>

<p>Looks wise, this is one of the most gorgeous games I’ve ever played. It looks like smooth claymation, but if every frame was washed over with watercolours and had the depth of field turned right up. Which albiet I’m sure one could do with Nvidia Ansel filters; but it looks downright wonderful when the game’s designed for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/d6c3943d0950b90e9ffc97c98285b3fb/3777bbba977a7535-c8/s540x810/8a896fda05f7b6fc8eb663a4102cb31ad1e7384e.jpg" alt="Very pretty game" title="This is such a good looking game." /></p>

<p><em>This is such a good looking game.</em></p>

<p>The puzzles, whilst they definitely could not be construed as difficult, are a very interesting idea. You take control of different people and try to end the day in such a way as they aren’t endangering themselves or Carl - ie. stopping a kid from running onto the road to get his ball back. This is done well, as whilst you may think you’ve solved a day, you’ll have to go back in time to put him in danger again in order to allow someone else to survive, but as you do this, you slowly open up more of the village to find other ways to protect everyone, adding a few metroidvania elements into the mix. And although time travel means there’s the potential for a lot of boring busywork, you don’t have to go back and do the same things repeatedly as once the game realises which choice you’re making, at’ll fade to the next bit so you don’t have to do the same puzzles over again.</p>

<p>It’s trying to, I assume, make the world feel very lovely. Everyone has huge heads which is for some reason associated with cuteness, and it’s set in a sweet old-timey little village. If you spin around too fast, Carl gets dizzy ad holds his glasses in a very endearing way. But it does come across as a little terrifying in all honesty. Why is everybody so short? They’re half the height of the doors in this town! Was it built by deceased giants? And what happened to everyone’s eyes?</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/d707ae6d984cb50df092090d2c7bd73d/3777bbba977a7535-a8/s540x810/f68d90600feabc01ffb84700ad930e3bc6b41389.jpg" alt="Terrifying hollow eyes" title="Why do they look dead?" /></p>

<p><em>Why do they look dead?</em></p>

<p>It is a very slow game - that much can’t be argued against. Whilst it’s not a massive map, it is the size of a small village (with apparently only six inhabitants, for reasons that were never explained) and I played most of the game holding down the sprint button. Or jog as it’s called, to fit in with the cutesy æsthetic. It’s also a little over-generous on the cutscenes. Seeing as the whole concept is somewhat groundhog day-esque, you will find yourself watching the same cutscenes several times; and I did end up browsing my RSS feeds during the more common ones.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec2714ce7cb9beb61c6eefece6d42ae4/3777bbba977a7535-5a/s540x810/e8996d15c93a02068b39620b506868a6039e5000.jpg" alt="Very short man" title="Why is he so short? He" /></p>

<p><em>Why is he so short? He’s a grown man, and his eyes are level with the door handle.</em></p>

<p>However, what many dialogue-free games do that this doesn’t, is make me want to know more about the world. Inside made me desperate to know what apocalyptic event had befallen the world to turn into the grey distopia that it is, Little Nightmares dragged me into the world of The Maw so much that I bought the comic, Last Day of June made me think “Huh. That was certainly an interesting game.”</p>

<hr />

<p>[+] Watercolour, claymation style graphics</p>

<p>[+] Interesting and original puzzle design</p>

<p>[+] Dialogue free story telling</p>

<p>[+] Calm and peaceful music</p>

<hr />

<p>[-] Repeated cutscenes</p>

<p>[-] Slow movement and slow gameplay</p>

<p>[-] Very simple puzzles</p>

<p>[-] In my opinion, and ending that was both odd, and a bit of a letdown</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>You should play this if: you want a calm, slow paced game that’s low energy and looks wonderful, and you don’t mind a bit of repetition and slow storytelling</strong></p>
