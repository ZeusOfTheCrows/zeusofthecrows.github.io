as the anbernic logo is _clearly_ inspired by the gameboy advance logo, i was surprised that nobody had done this before me; but _c'est la vie_

the .svg file [is available here](/assets/images/anbernic/bootlogo.svg), for anyone who wants to make a version with their own colours, or make any other edits

#### Install Instructions

##### MuOS

i'm too lazy to write any, so:

> If you have MuOS, you have to access the directory MUOS\theme on your sd card. Extract the Zip file of the theme you want to costumize [sic]. Then you have to drag the boot logo that you want as a .bmp file into the directory „themename“\image and replace the default bootlogo. After that you will have to zip the files (font,music,image,scheme,sound,credits) again and place the „themename“.zip in the directory MUOS\theme on your sd card.

there's probably an easier way to do this, but i don't know of it

### Game Boy Advance - Purple

before making this, i thought i knew what the gba logo looked like - turns out i have no idea. it's either blue and sharp ([exhibit a.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/a/a1/Gameboy_advance_logo_stacked.svg/revision/latest?cb=20220620020941)), or purple and rounded ([exhibit b.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/8/8e/Game-boy-advance-logo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20211001195618)). i decided to go with purple and sharp because i think that's what looks better, and i swear that's what i remember it looking like

### Game Boy Advance - Red

<a href="/assets/images/anbernic/gba-red/bootlogo.bmp" download>Download</a>

something a little easier on the eyes than bright white. i went with the anbernic brand colour (`#DA1217`) rather than the nintendo `#E60012` as, ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯, it's an anbernic device, i guess?

### Game Child - Red

i mean it's a knock-off, mildly illegal, cheap handheld. it's begging for an ashens reference. (this is the one i personally use.)
