## Pixtura Corvida

[Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/pixtura-corvida.ttf) ¦ [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1954327/)

pixelled blackletter/textura font. includes basic cyrillic/greek support. metrics kind of need work though. i'm working on a non-pixel version as well, which i'll link to here if i remember.

## Ocean Vice (Proto)

[Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/ocean-vice-proto.ttf) ¦ [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1950206/)

started as an emulation of the font from the ocean view hotel in gta: vice city. not really very finished, that's why it's marked as proto.

## Various Pixelfonts

Tiny: [Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/tiny-mono.ttf) ¦ [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1837063/) ¦ Rounded: [Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/rounded-pixelfont.ttf) ¦ [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1411349/) ¦ Inverted: [Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/rounded-pixelfont.ttf) ¦ [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1418874/)

assorted pixelated fonts. **tiny mono**: the smallest legible font i could make - lowercase is 3×3, uppercase is 3×4. **rounded**: rounded(ish) font that i was quite pleased with. **inverted**: y'know, i don't think this one is anything special, but it did get staff pick on fontstruck and is currently my my highest rated, so i had to include it.
