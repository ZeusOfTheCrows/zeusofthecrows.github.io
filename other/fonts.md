### DSegstended

14Seg: [Download](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/DSegstended/releases/latest/download/DSeg14.zip) {{ site.sep_char }} 7Seg: [Download](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/DSegstended/releases/latest/download/DSeg7.zip) {{ site.sep_char }} [Github](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/DSegstended/)

my fork of keshikan's excellent dseg font, with cyrillic [кирилица] and greek [ελληνικο, no diacritics/tonal marks] support, several more characters, and a few changed glyphs. comes with a voluminous quantity of weights, and four different styles (classic, classic-mini, modern, and modern-mini).

### Pixtura Corvida

[Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/pixtura-corvida.ttf) {{ site.sep_char }} [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1954327/)

pixelled blackletter/textura font. includes basic cyrillic/greek support. metrics kind of need work though. i'm working on a non-pixel version as well, which i'll link to here if i remember.

### Ocean Vice (Proto)

[Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/ocean-vice-proto.ttf) {{ site.sep_char }} [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1950206/)

started as an emulation of the font from the ocean view hotel in gta: vice city. not really very finished, that's why it's marked as proto.

### Various Pixelfonts

Tiny: [Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/tiny-mono.ttf) {{ site.sep_char }} [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1837063/) {{ site.sep_char }} Rounded: [Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/rounded-pixelfont.ttf) {{ site.sep_char }} [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1411349/) {{ site.sep_char }} Inverted: [Download](/assets/fonts/fontstruct/rounded-pixelfont.ttf) {{ site.sep_char }} [Fontforge](https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1418874/)

assorted pixelated fonts.

* **tiny mono**: the smallest legible font i could make - lowercase is 3×3 (apart from asc/decenders), uppercase is 3×4.
* **rounded**: rounded(ish) font that i was quite pleased with.
* **inverted**: y'know, i don't think this one is anything special, but it did get staff pick on fontstruck and is currently my my highest rated, so i had to include it.
