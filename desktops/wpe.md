# Wallpaper Engine Presets

## Amber Dec Teminal

[Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2271074053) ¦ [Github](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/we-amber-terminal/tree/master)

I decided to rewrite [my rainmeter preset]({{ "desktops/rainmeter#amber-dec-terminal" | relative_url }}) into wallpaper engine for  performance reasons, and I thought I'd put it up on steam workshop. Retro styled DEC VT100 terminal desktop, with clock radio. I know the  VT100 wasn't amber, but I think it looks better - change it to green if  you like..

All WE UI user properties should reflect properly, [source is available here](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/we-amber-terminal).
