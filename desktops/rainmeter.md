## Amber Dec Teminal

[Zip File]({{ "assets/rainmeter/terminal.zip" | relative_url}}) ¦ [Folder]({{ "assets/rainmeter/terminal" | relative_url}})

Little uglier than [my WPE engine version]({{ "desktops/wpengine#amber-dec-terminal" | relative_url}}), due to limitations of rainmeter, but much more functional: it can launch customisable programmes, websites, etc. It actually came first, but I'm only just uploading it. I'm a little uncomfortable uploading some of the things that are bundled with it, but I have done so for future-proofing reasons (I, too, enjoy digital archæology). Please go and give some love to the original creators of [FixedSys Excelsior](http://www.fixedsysexcelsior.com/) [(Github)](https://github.com/kika/fixedsys), [DSEG7/DSEG14](https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html) [(Github)](https://github.com/keshikan/DSEG), and the [original rainmeter](https://www.deviantart.com/maxcorpindustries/art/Vintage-Terminal-1-0-for-rainmeter-831562992) that instpired this, that I also pilfered the wallpaper from.
