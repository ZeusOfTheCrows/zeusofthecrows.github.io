This website will (eventually) have links to all my work that's available online

Please feel free to contact me about anything. I inevitably won't respond, but don't take that personally, it's just how I am. 

Current: Mid-20s, living in UK.

Interests: Everything useless (font design, Greco-roman mythology, the oxford comma, etc.)

Keyboard layout: as close to [this](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/706d745d94785947cd75d64f6cd978f9) as I can get on an ISO 105 key

OS: Windows. Not because I like it, but because Linux just isn't very good. (I know I'm going to get hatemail about that)

Music: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5q8crqSxKiqtpIKnAgkYRU?si=UEucTXZZRP2mZ2PBVUpY1A) \| [M3U]({{ "/assets/text/music.m3u/" | relative_url }}) \| [YT Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxu-Tz00k18Ef1lyMdoGFgPkcxrM115jp) (generated automatically, missing several songs)

Other social tedia: [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zeusofthecrows/) \| [Discord](https://discord.app/ZeusOfTheCrows#0492 "ZeusOfTheCrows#0492") \| [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeusOfTheCrows/overview)  
(If you message me on any of these, I will respond very slowly; don't be offended)
