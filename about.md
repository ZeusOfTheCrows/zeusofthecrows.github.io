This website will (eventually) have links to all my work that's available online

Please feel free to contact me about anything. I inevitably won't respond, but don't take that personally, it's just how I am. 

Current: Mid-20s, male, white, living in UK. (Yes, I realise)

Interests: Everything useless (font design, Greco-roman mythology, the oxford comma, etc.)

Keyboard layout: as close to this as I can get on an ISO 105 key

OS: Windows. Not because I like it, but because Linux just isn't very good. (I know I'm going to get hatemail about that)

Music: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5q8crqSxKiqtpIKnAgkYRU?si=UEucTXZZRP2mZ2PBVUpY1A) \| YT Music coming soon
