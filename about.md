This website will (eventually) have links to all my work that's available online. all content on this site, unless otherwise specified, is free for personal and commercial use for individuals, non-profits, and institutions with fewer than 3 employees.

Please feel free to contact me about anything. I inevitably won't respond, but don't take that personally, it's just how I am. 

Current: Mid-20s, living in UK.

Interests: Everything useless (font design, Greco-roman mythology, the oxford comma, etc.)

Keyboard layout: as close to [this](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/706d745d94785947cd75d64f6cd978f9) as I can get on an ISO 105 key

OS: Windows. Not because I like it, but because Linux just isn't very good. (I know I'm going to get hatemail about that)
