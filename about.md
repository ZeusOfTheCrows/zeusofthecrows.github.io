# Welcome to my little corner of the internet

Proudly no Javascript, trackers, or analytics

if you notice casing is inconsistent, i've recently given up on majuscule letters, but don't want to update all my old pages

## About Me:

miscellany: 

* i prefer #hexa colours to #ahex
* i own a crt monitor
* i plan to read the wh40k horus heresy books, but haven't got around to it

Current: Mid-20s, living in UK.

Interests: Everything useless (font design, Greco-roman mythology, the oxford comma, etc.)

Likes: tea, reading, video games, travelling

Dislikes: electron-based programmes, voids, finishing things

Keyboard layout: as close to [this](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/706d745d94785947cd75d64f6cd978f9) as I can get on an ISO 105 key

OS: Windows. Not because I like it, but because Linux just isn't very good. (I know I'm going to get hatemail about that)

Music: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5q8crqSxKiqtpIKnAgkYRU?si=UEucTXZZRP2mZ2PBVUpY1A): most genres apart from hiphop/rnb. mostly rock/metal, but a plenty of synthwave (mostly sovietwave), new wave, 1st/2nd wave country, and others.
