i'm very good at not finishing things, so expect this site to be a continual work in progress...

this site should be perfectly usable on line mode browsers (tested on lynx). if it has accessibility issues, please let me know: i'm not so good at that sort of thing, so would like to be told if/how to improve.

<small class="weak">(text will look blurry in webkit browsers, due to the fact that they use subpixel antialiasing by default. i'm afraid there's nothing i can do to fix this, as far as i know. vive la fox)</small>
