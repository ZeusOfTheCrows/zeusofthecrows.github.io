# Welcome!

**Proudly JavaScript free!**

welcome to a miscellany of things i've made for my own benefit, things i've found cool, and anything else i feel like putting up here. /!\ **warning: most showcase pages have large images, be wary if using data or a metred network** /!\

i'm not great at words, but if you really must have some check my about page

i'm very good at not finishing things, so expect this site to be a continual work in progress...

<small class="weak">(text will look blurry in webkit browsers, due to the fact that they use subpixel antialiasing by default. i'm afraid there's nothing i can do to fix this, as far as i know. vive la fox)</small>

<!-- post saying site finished. -->

<!-- /?\ ztodo limit post list to a few posts, add an archive page -->

<!-- fix contents/intro formatting -->
