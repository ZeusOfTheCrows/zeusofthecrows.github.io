**save yourself a google, and display the values in game.** display the number of souls acquired from soldier's, hero's, and demon's soul items on the icon. the remake version has some of the icons i liked from the bluepoint remake.

### Hylian Shield for SotFS

[Download](/assets/zips/games/mods/ds2/hylian-shield-sotfs.7z) ¦  [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/967)

retexture of the drangleic  shield to the hylian shield from zelda: breath of the wild/skyward  sword. this originally started as a port of [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/227) to sotfs; but it had a few jpeg artifacts and once i tried to reduce those, i found it easier to just recreate it from scratch.

requires igp11, may get you banned from online, caveat emptor, etc.

* to install:
	* place .dds texture files in igp11's tex_override folder.
	* you can ignore the .png and .afphoto files, but i've included them in case anyone wants to edit this mod.

**save yourself a google, and display the values in game.** optional boss souls icons (they're quite nice icons, and a lot of them share the same icon so it can look a bit cluttered)

demon's souls version [here](#svi-des)

	* Download iGP11
	* Unpack the files from either `.\w-boss-souls` or `.\no-boss-souls` to `[game_directory]\Game\iGP11\tex_override`

# Detailed UI - DS1 style ticks

[Download](/assets/zips/games/mods/ds3/detailed-ui-w-ticks.7z) ¦  [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1015)

I like [this mod ](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/91)by Celice, but﻿ I miss the little bars from DS1 that let you easily and quickly see your health level. I didn't want to take downloads away from the original though, so install that one first and then overwrite it  with this one.

- To install:
  - Download the iGP11, and the [Detailed UI mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/91)﻿
  - Unpack files from `[detailed_ui]` to `[game_directory]\Game\iGP11\tex_override`
  - Copy [`65536_12[..]05.dds`]( "65536_12831202783399872305.dds") to `[game_directory]\Game\iGP11\tex_override`, replacing the other
    - ﻿(If you want to replace the blood echoes symbol with a normal souls symbol)
    - ﻿copy [`65536_25[..]59.dds`]( "65536_2579900381049114659.dds") as well
