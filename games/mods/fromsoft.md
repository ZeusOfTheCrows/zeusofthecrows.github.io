## Demon's Souls

### Soul Value Icons

Normal: [Download](/assets/zips/games/mods/des/soul-values.7z) ¦ Remake [Download](/assets/zips/games/mods/des/soul-values-remake.7z) ¦  [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/demonssouls/mods/51)

**save yourself a google, and display the values in game.** display the number of souls acquired from soldier's, hero's, and demon's soul items on the icon. the remake version has some of the icons i liked from the bluepoint remake.

## Dark Souls II

### Hylian Shield for SotFS

[Download](/assets/zips/games/mods/ds1/soul-values-remake.7z) ¦  [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/demonssouls/mods/51)

retexture of the drangleic  shield to the hylian shield from zelda: breath of the wild/skyward  sword. this originally started as a port of[ this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/227) to sotfs; but it had a few jpeg artifacts and once i tried to reduce those, i found it easier to just recreate it from scratch.

requires igp11, may get you banned from online, caveat emptor, etc. to install, place .dds texture files in igp11's tex_override folder. you can ignore the .png and .afphoto files, but i've included them in case anyone wants to edit this mod.
